  abstract = {The Niger delta is intensely dissected by a network of rivers which erode and continuously reshape their banks resulting in net riverbank recessions. The rates of bank recession depend on season, soil type, bank height and stratigraphy, flow velocity and relative location along the river system. Bank failures occur by several mechanisms. These include; rotational, translational, overhang/toppling and flow mechanisms. Bank failure episodes are concentrated at the early stages of lowering of channel water level due to the sensitivity of banks to removal of passive resistance. High ground-water level accentuates seepage erosion which reduces bank stability. To realistically predict the behaviour of river banks, the method of evaluation must recognise the dynamic nature of the controlling factors. \textcopyright{} 1993.},

  abstract = {Field surveys document the accumulation of large woody debris (LWD) into structurally distinctive jam types in the alluvial channel of the Queets River on the Olympic Peninsula of north west Washington. Calculations, field observations and historical evidence show that these jams can form stable structures controlling local channel hydraulics and providing refugia for riparian forest development over decades and possibly centuries. Distinctive spatial patterns of LWD, pools, bars and forested islands form in association with particular jam types. The deposition of key member logs initiates the formation of stable bar apex and meander jams that alter the local flow hydraulics and thereby the spatial characteristics of scour and deposition leading to pool and bar formation. Historical evidence and the age structure of forest patches documents the temporal development of alluvial topography associated with these jam types. Bar apex jams, for example, are associated with a crescentic pool, an upstream arcuate bar and a downstream central bar that is the focus of forest patch development. Experimental and empirical studies in hydraulic engineering accurately predict channel scour associated with jams. Individual jams can be remarkably stable, providing long-term bank protection that creates local refugia for mature forest patches within a valley floor environment characterized by rapid channel migration and frequent disturbance. Processes controlling the formation, structure and stability of naturally occurring LWD jams are fundamental to the dynamics of forested river ecosystems and provide insights into the design of both habitat restoration structures and ecosystem-based watershed management.},

  abstract = {Since the 1930s, combined streamflow from the largest Eurasian rivers discharging to the Arctic Ocean has been increasing. For many of these rivers, an increase in annual streamflow volume has been accompanied by a shift in seasonality (e.g., earlier snowmelt runoff in the spring). These changes in annual and seasonal streamflow may be due to direct effects of climate change (e.g., increased precipitation, or changes in snow accumulation and ablation patterns), indirect effects of climate change (e.g., changes in permafrost), or human effects (e.g., storage and release of river runoff in reservoirs). We develop and describe a method to estimate the potential contributions of artificial reservoirs to long-term changes in annual and seasonal streamflow between 1937 and 1998. Reservoir effects on downstream flow are simulated using a reservoir routing model coupled off-line to the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) land surface hydrology model for the Lena, Yenisei and Ob' river basins. The effects of reservoirs on basin average evaporation are also represented. We perform trend analysis on long-term ({$\surd\cent$},\"A{$\infty\lnot\bullet$}30 years) time series of seasonal and annual streamflow and isolate the effects of reservoirs. Although reservoirs have had little effect on trends in annual discharge from the Lena, Yenisei, and Ob' river basins, we conclude that they are responsible for many of the seasonal changes that have been observed. For the Lena, reservoirs account for up to 80\% and 30\% of the observed winter and spring trends, respectively. For the Yenisei, reservoirs account for up to 100\%, 40\%, and 60\% to 100\% of the observed winter, spring, and late summer to early fall trends, respectively. For the Ob', reservoirs may account for more than 70\% of the observed trends during the months of January to March. A result of this study is a set of reconstructed streamflow at the outlets of the Lena, Yenisei, and Ob' river basins which can be used in subsequent studies to improve the understanding of climate change effects on runoff generation in the Eurasian Arctic.},

  volume = {21},
  pages = {1807--1828},
  abstract = {River runoff to the Arctic Ocean has increased over the last century, primarily during the winter and spring and primarily from the major Eurasian rivers. Some recent studies have suggested that the additional runoff is due to increased northward transport of atmospheric moisture (and associated increased precipitation), but other studies show inconsistencies in long-term runoff and precipitation trends, perhaps partly due to biases in the observational datasets. Through trend analysis of precipitation, temperature, and streamflow data, the authors investigate the extent to which Eurasian Arctic river discharge changes are attributable to precipitation and temperature changes as well as to reservoir construction and operation between the years of 1936 and 2000. Two new datasets are applied: a gridded precipitation product, in which the low-frequency variability is constrained to match that of long-term bias-corrected precipitation station data, and a reconstructed streamflow product, in which the effects of reservoirs have been minimized using a physically based reservoir model. It is found that reservoir operations have primarily affected streamflow seasonality, increasing winter discharge and decreasing summer discharge. To understand the influences of climate on streamflow changes, the authors hypothesize three cases that would cause precipitation trends to be inconsistent with streamflow trends: first, for the coldest basins in northeastern Siberia, streamflow should be sensitive to warming primarily as a result of the melting of excess ground ice, and for these basins positive streamflow trends may exceed precipitation trends in magnitude; second, evapotranspiration (ET) in the warmer regions of western Siberia and European Russia is sensitive to warming and increased precipitation, therefore observed precipitation trends may exceed streamflow trends; and third, streamflow from the central Siberian basins should respond to both effects. It is found that, in general, these hypotheses hold true. In the coldest basins, streamflow trends diverged from precipitation trends starting in the 1950s to 1960s, and this divergence accelerated thereafter. In the warmest basins, precipitation trends consistently exceeded streamflow trends, suggesting that increased precipitation contributed to increases in both ET and streamflow. In the central basins, permafrost degradation and ET effects appear to be contributing to long-term streamflow trends in varying degrees for each basin. The results herein suggest that the extent and state of the permafrost underlying a basin is a complicating factor in understanding long-term changes in Eurasian Arctic river discharge.},

  abstract = {Growing interest in global environmental issues has led to the need for global and regional assessment of water resources. A global water assessment model called ``WaterGAP 2'' is described, which consists of two main components'a Global Water Use model and a Global Hydrology model. These components are used to compute water use and availability on the river basin level. The Global Water Use model consists of (a) domestic and industry sectors which take into account the effect of structural and technological changes on water use, and (b) an agriculture sector which accounts especially for the effect of climate on irrigation water requirements. The Global Hydrology model calculates surface runoff and groundwater recharge based on the computation of daily water balances of the soil and canopy. A water balance is also performed for surface waters, and river flow is routed via a global flow routing scheme. The Global Hydrology model provides a testable method for taking into account the effects of climate and land cover on runoff. The components of the model have been calibrated and tested against data on water use and runoff from river basins throughout the world. Although its performance can and needs to be improved, the WaterGAP 2 model already provides a consistent method to fill in many of the existing gaps in water resources data in many parts of the world. It also provides a coherent approach for generating scenarios of changes in water resources. Hence, it is especially useful as a tool for globally comparing the water situation in river basins.},

Changes in magnitude and frequency of extreme streamflow events are investigated by statistical distribution fitting and peak over threshold analysis. A consistent method is proposed to evaluate the agreement of ensemble projections. Results indicate that the change in frequency of discharge extremes is likely to have a larger impact on the overall flood hazard as compared to the change in their magnitude. On average, in Europe, flood peaks with return periods above 100 years are projected to double in frequency within 3 decades.},

  abstract = {Surface fresh water is essential for life, yet we have surprisingly poor knowledge of the spatial and temporal dynamics of surface freshwater discharge and changes in storage globally. For example, we are unable to answer such basic questions as ``What is the spatial and temporal variability of water stored on and near the surface of all continents?'' Furthermore, key societal issues, such as the susceptibility of life to flood hazards, cannot be answered with the current global, in situ networks designed to observe river discharge at points but not flood events. The measurements required to answer these hydrologic questions are surface water area, the elevation of the water surface (h), its slope ({$\partial$}h/{$\partial$}x), and temporal change ({$\partial$}h/{$\partial$}t). Advances in remote sensing hydrology, particularly over the past 10 years and even more recently, have demonstrated that these hydraulic variables can be measured reliably from orbiting platforms. Measurements of inundated area have been used to varying degrees of accuracy as proxies for discharge but are successful only when in situ data are available for calibration; they fail to indicate the dynamic topography of water surfaces. Radar altimeters have a rich, multidecadal history of successfully measuring elevations of the ocean surface and are now also accepted as capable tools for measuring h along orbital profiles crossing freshwater bodies. However, altimeters are profiling tools, which, because of their orbital spacings, miss too many freshwater bodies to be useful hydrologically. High spatial resolution images of {$\partial$}h/{$\partial$}t have been observed with interferometric synthetic aperture radar, but the method requires emergent vegetation to scatter radar pulses back to the receiving antenna. Essentially, existing spaceborne methods have been used to measure components of surface water hydraulics, but none of the technologies can singularly supply the water volume and hydraulic measurements that are needed to accurately model the water cycle and to guide water management practices. Instead, a combined imaging and elevation-measuring approach is ideal as demonstrated by the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), which collected images of h at a high spatial resolution ({$\sim$}90 m) thus permitting the calculation of {$\partial$}h/{$\partial$}x. We suggest that a future satellite concept, the Water and Terrestrial Elevation Recovery mission, will improve upon the SRTM design to permit multitemporal mappings of h across the world's wetlands, floodplains, lakes, reservoirs, and rivers.},

These changes have a profound impact on the carbon cycle that directly affects the air\textendash sea exchange of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), possibly leading to substantial feedback on atmospheric CO 2 concentration. Several recent studies have indicated such feedback but the future quantitative impact is very uncertain. To minimize these uncertainties, there is a need for extensive field studies in order to achieve both a better process understanding as well as to detect probable trends in these processes.

Hydraulic geometry relationships have a long history in estimating river channel characteristics as a function of discharge. A simple near-global database of bankfull widths and depths (along with confidence intervals) was developed based on hydraulic geometry equations and the HydroSHEDS hydrography data set. The bankfull width estimates were evaluated with widths derived from Landsat imagery for reaches of nine major rivers, showing errors ranging from 8 to 62\% (correlation of 0.88), although it was difficult to verify whether the satellite observations corresponded to bankfull conditions. Bankfull depth estimates were compared with in situ measurements at sites in the Ohio and Willamette rivers, producing a mean error of 24\%. The uncertainties in the derivation approach and a number of caveats are identified, and ways to improve the database in the future are discussed. Despite these limitations, this is the first global database that can be used directly in hydraulic models or as a set of constraints in model calibration.},

Remote sensing is now providing a near-global record of floodplain inundation and can be a viable strategy for large-scale monitoring of flood inundation. However, uncertainties in these observations and the need for forecasting requires their fusion with hydrodynamic models. Data assimilation algorithms can merge observations with models, providing optimal estimates of flood characteristics by taking into account the errors in both models and observations. The objective of this chapter is to provide a brief overview of data assimilation in river hydrodynamic and flood modeling and present some examples from a specific case study. Finally, some of the challenges and opportu\- nities are discussed in the context of assessing flood hazard over large scales (such as continental and global).},

Those cross sections narrower than the mean reach width filled at discharges less than bankfull and scoured at discharges greater than bankfull. Those cross sections wider than the mean reach width scoured at discharges less than bankfull and filled at discharges greater than bankfull. The accumulation and depletion of sand-sized bed material in a cross section was concentrated in the near-bank parts of the stream channel and thus significantly influenced bank stability and retreat. A resurvey in the summer of 1980 of the cross sections located in straight reaches showed that those cross sections which scoured at discharges greater than bankfull had become 2-4 feet wider, whereas those cross sections which filled at discharges greater than bankfull were unchanged. Thus bank stability and to some extent the adjustment of stream channel width in the East Fork River study reach appears to be controlled by the processes of scour and fill.\textendash Modified from journal.},

As well as being theoretically (near-)optimal, the method does not suffer from the `curse of dimensionality' and can comfortably handle multivariate parameter estimation. We demonstrate the potential of this method in identical twin testing with an intermediate complexity coupled AOGCM. The model's climatology is successfully tuned via the simultaneous estimation of 12 parameters. Several minor modifications arc described by which the method was adapted to a steady state (temporally averaged) case. The method is relatively simple to implement, and with only O(50) model runs required, we believe that optimal parameter estimation is now accessible even to computationally demanding models.},

Pluvial flash floods arise from rainfall before it reaches a watercourse and may cause severe flooding of land and properties far from rivers. River flash floods, like pluvial floods, have the characteristic of rapid speed of response, a principal source of risk to life. Intense rainfall can generate `walls of water' in river courses which can propagate long distances downstream and steepen, without upstream structural failure. Steeply rising wavefronts more commonly occur on steep upland catchments but, where intensities of extreme short period rainfall are sufficient, such wavefronts can also occur on lowland catchments. A definition of flash floods from intense rainfall, relevant to British landscape and climate, is proposed.},

The classification of individuals into smaller units, which in turn are grouped into larger units, can induce contextual effects. On the other hand, a scaling effect can occur due to the aggregation of data from smaller units into larger units. In this paper, we propose a shared multilevel model to address the contextual effects. In addition, we consider a shared multiscale model to adjust for both scale and contextual effects simultaneously. We also study convolution and independent multiscale models, which are special cases of shared multilevel and shared multiscale models, respectively. We compare the performance of the models by applying them to real and simulated data sets. We found that the shared multiscale model was the best model across a range of simulated and real scenarios as measured by the deviance information criterion (DIC) and the Watanabe Akaike information criterion (WAIC).},

We propose a conceptual hydroecological model to explain the disturbance mechanisms driving species diversity across large river floodplains. These ecosystems harbor a unique set of flood-tolerant species different from the surrounding upland vegetation. In elevation gradients across pristine floodplains, the greater the flooding, the fewer the number of plant species. As terrain elevation increases, flood depth and duration decrease and it is more likely that species composition is influenced by external natural or human-driven disturbances. The spatial interaction between the natural flood regime and upland factors creates patterns of disturbance gradients that influence how floodplain vegetation establishes. In regions where upland conditions are subject to strong external disturbances, species diversity peaks at intermediate stages along the disturbance gradient. We demonstrate this concept with observations from the Central Amazon and Pantanal in Brazil, the Mekong's Tonle Sap in Cambodia, and the Okavango Delta in Botswana. We discuss how this model could be further elaborated and validated to inform management of large river basins under the impact of upstream-induced flood pulse alterations.},

It is based on the estimation of flood frequency relationships at a grid resolution of 0.5 \texttimes{} 0.5\textdegree, using a global hydrological model with climate scenarios derived from 21 climate models, together with projections of future population. Four indicators of the flood hazard are calculated; change in the magnitude and return period of flood peaks, flood-prone population and cropland exposed to substantial change in flood frequency, and a generalised measure of regional flood risk based on combining frequency curves with generic flood damage functions. Under one climate model, emissions and socioeconomic scenario (HadCM3 and SRES A1b), in 2050 the current 100-year flood would occur at least twice as frequently across 40 \% of the globe, approximately 450 million flood-prone people and 430 thousand km2 of flood-prone cropland would be exposed to a doubling of flood frequency, and global flood risk would increase by approximately 187 \% over the risk in 2050 in the absence of climate change. There is strong regional variability (most adverse impacts would be in Asia), and considerable variability between climate models. In 2050, the range in increased exposure across 21 climate models under SRES A1b is 31\textendash 450 million people and 59 to 430 thousand km2 of cropland, and the change in risk varies between -9 and +376 \%. The paper presents impacts by region, and also presents relationships between change in global mean surface temperature and impacts on the global flood hazard. There are a number of caveats with the analysis; it is based on one global hydrological model only, the climate scenarios are constructed using pattern-scaling, and the precise impacts are sensitive to some of the assumptions in the definition and application.},

This paper highlights the bank erosion and channel evolution induced by eleven different flood events in a 7-km long reach of the River Chenab, Pakistan. The impact of floods on river bank erosion and channel evolution is analyzed under low and high flow conditions. Flood-induced changes, for river's external banks and channel evolution, were assessed by processing Landsat ETM+ images in ArcGIS tool, and their inter-relationship is evaluated through regression analysis. The results revealed that the major morphological changes were triggered by the flood events occurred during the high flow or Monsoon season (July\textendash September), whereas the flood events of similar magnitude occurring during low flow season (October\textendash March) did not induce such changes. Mostly, the erosion remained limited to the middle part of the reach, where the branch channel flows along the bank. The average annual bank erosion rates are much higher as compared with a global scale. Data analysis showed a strong correlation between the mean high flows and total bank erosion indicating that Monsoon seasonal flows and floods are responsible for bank erosion. The present study further identifies the river bank locations highly susceptible to erosion by developing the correlation between bank erosion and branch channel progression. Strong correlation for bank erosion could be established with the shift of branch channels position flowing along the banks in braided reaches of sand bed rivers. However, the presence of sand bars along the river banks resulted in reduced erosion that weakens this relationship. The findings of the present study can help develop better understanding about the bank erosion process and constitute a key element to inform and improve river bank management.},

A recently developed surface\textendash subsurface model for permafrost thermal hydrology, the Advanced Terrestrial Simulator (ATS), is used in combination with field measurements to achieve the goals of constructing a process-rich model based on plausible parameters and to identify fine-scale controls of ALT in ice-wedge polygon tundra in Barrow, Alaska. An iterative model refinement procedure that cycles between borehole temperature and snow cover measurements and simulations functions to evaluate and parameterize different model processes necessary to simulate freeze\textendash thaw processes and ALT formation. After model refinement and calibration, reasonable matches between simulated and measured soil temperatures are obtained, with the largest errors occurring during early summer above ice wedges (e.g., troughs). The results suggest that properly constructed and calibrated one-dimensional thermal hydrology models have the potential to provide reasonable representation of the subsurface thermal response and can be used to infer model input parameters and process representations. The models for soil thermal conductivity and snow distribution were found to be the most sensitive process representations. However, information on lateral flow and snowpack evolution might be needed to constrain model representations of surface hydrology and snow depth.},

  abstract = {AbstractThe Arctic climate is changing, inducing accelerating retreat of ice-rich permafrost coastal bluffs. Along Alaska's Beaufort Sea coast, erosion rates have increased roughly threefold from 6.8 to 19 m yr-1 since 1955 while the sea ice-free season has increased roughly twofold from 45 to 100 days since 1979. We develop a numerical model of bluff retreat to assess the relative roles of the length of sea ice-free season, sea level, water temperature, nearshore wavefield, and permafrost temperature in controlling erosion rates in this setting. The model captures the processes of erosion observed in short-term monitoring experiments along the Beaufort Sea coast, including evolution of melt notches, topple of ice wedge-bounded blocks, and degradation of these blocks. Model results agree with time-lapse imagery of bluff evolution and time series of ocean-based instrumentation. Erosion is highly episodic with 40\% of erosion is accomplished during less than 5\% of the sea ice-free season. Among the formulations of the submarine erosion rate we assessed, we advocate those that employ both water temperature and nearshore wavefield. As high water levels are a prerequisite for erosion, any future changes that increase the frequency with which water levels exceed the base of the bluffs will increase rates of coastal erosion. The certain increases in sea level and potential changes in storminess will both contribute to this effect. As water temperature also influences erosion rates, any further expansion of the sea ice-free season into the midsummer period of greatest insolation is likely to result in an additional increase in coastal retreat rates.},

  abstract = {A large number of rivers in Tuscany have channel planforms, which are neither straight nor what is usually understood as meandering. In the typical case, they consist of an almost straight, slightly incised main channel fringed with large lateral bars and lunate-shaped embayments eroded into the former flood plain. In the past, these rivers have not been recognised as an individual category and have often been considered to be either braided or meandering. It is suggested here that this type of river planform be termed pseudomeandering. A typical pseudomeandering river (the Cecina River) is described and analysed to investigate the main factors responsible for producing this channel pattern. A study reach (100 x 300 m) was surveyed in detail and related to data on discharge, channel changes after floods and grain-size distribution of bed sediments. During 18 months of topographic monitoring, the inner lateral bar in the study reach expanded and migrated towards the concave outer bank which, concurrently, retreated by as much as 25 m. A sediment balance was constructed to analyse bar growth and bank retreat in relation to sediment supply and channel morphology. The conditions necessary to maintain the pseudomeandering morphology of these rivers by preventing them from developing a meandering planform, are discussed and interpreted as a combination of a few main factors such as the flashy character of floods, sediment supply (influenced by both natural processes and human impact), the morphological effects of discharges with contrasting return intervals and the short duration of flood events. Finally, the channel response to floods with variable sediment transport capacity (represented by bed shear stress) is analysed using a simple model. It is demonstrated that bend migration is associated with moderate floods while major floods are responsible for the development of chute channels, which act to suppress bend growth and maintain the low sinuosity configuration of the river. \textcopyright{} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {The need to attenuate hydrograph peaks is central to the design of stormwater and flood control systems. However, few guidelines exist for siting hydraulic control structures such that system-scale benefits are maximized. This study presents a new graph-theoretic algorithm for stabilizing the hydrologic response of watersheds by placing controllers at strategic locations in the drainage network. This algorithm identifies subcatchments that dominate the peak of the hydrograph, and then finds the ``cuts'' in the drainage network that maximally isolate these subcatchments, thereby flattening the hydrologic response. Evaluating the performance of the algorithm through an ensemble of hydrodynamic simulations, we find that our controller placement algorithm produces consistently flatter discharges than randomized controller configurations\textemdash both in terms of the peak discharge and the overall variance of the hydrograph. By attenuating flashy flows, our algorithm provides a powerful methodology for mitigating flash floods, reducing erosion, and protecting aquatic ecosystems. More broadly, we show that controller placement exerts an important influence on the hydrologic response and demonstrate that analysis of drainage network structure can inform more effective stormwater control policies.},

  abstract = {Numerous previous studies have constructed models to estimate base flow characteristics from climatic and physiographic characteristics of catchments and applied these to ungauged regions. However, these studies generally used streamflow observations from a relatively small number of catchments ({$<$}200) located in small, homogeneous study areas, which may have led to less reliable models with limited applicability elsewhere. Here, we use streamflow observations from a highly heterogeneous set of 3394 catchments ({$<$}10,000 km2) worldwide to construct reliable, widely applicable models based on 18 climatic and physiographic characteristics to estimate two important base flow characteristics: (1) the base flow index (BFI), defined as the ratio of long-term mean base flow to total streamflow; and (2) the base flow recession constant (k), defined as the rate of base flow decay. Regression analysis results revealed that BFI and k were related to several climatic and physiographic characteristics, notably mean annual potential evaporation, mean snow water equivalent depth, and abundance of surface water bodies. Ensembles of artificial neural networks (ANNs; obtained by subsampling the original set of catchments) were trained to estimate the base flow characteristics from climatic and physiographic data. The catchment-scale estimation of the base flow characteristics demonstrated encouraging performance with R2 values of 0.82 for BFI and 0.72 for k. The connection weights of the trained ANNs indicated that climatic characteristics were more important for estimating k than BFI. Global maps of estimated BFI and k were obtained using global climatic and physiographic data as input to the derived models. The resulting global maps are available for free download at http://www.hydrology-amsterdam.nl.},

Observed Q from 3000 to 4000 small-to-medium-sized catchments (10\textendash 10 000 km2) around the globe were used to train neural network ensembles to estimate Q characteristics based on climate and physiographic characteristics of the catchments. In total, 17 Q characteristics were selected, including mean annual Q, baseflow index, and a number of flow percentiles. Testing coefficients of determination for the estimation of the Q characteristics ranged from 0.55 for the baseflow recession constant to 0.93 for the Q timing. Overall, climate indices dominated among the predictors. Predictors related to soils and geology were relatively unimportant, perhaps because of their data quality. The trained neural network ensembles were subsequently applied spatially over the entire ice-free land surface, resulting in global maps of the Q characteristics (at 0.125\textdegree{} resolution). These maps possess several unique features: they represent observation-driven estimates, they are based on an unprecedentedly large set of catchments, and they have associated uncertainty estimates. The maps can be used for various hydrological applications, including the diagnosis of macroscale hydrological models. To demonstrate this, the produced maps were compared to equivalent maps derived from the simulated daily Q of four macroscale hydrological models, highlighting various opportunities for improvement in model Q behavior. The produced dataset is available online (http://water.jrc.ec.europa.eu/GSCD).},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Current global precipitation (\emph{P}) datasets do not take full advantage of the complementary nature of satellite and reanalysis data. Here, we present Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP) version 1.1, a global \emph{P} dataset for the period 1979\&ndash;2015 with a 3-hourly temporal and 0.25\textdegree{} spatial resolution, specifically designed for hydrological modeling. The design philosophy of MSWEP was to optimally merge the highest quality \emph{P} data sources available as a function of timescale and location. The long-term mean of MSWEP was based on the CHPclim dataset but replaced with more accurate regional datasets where available. A correction for gauge under-catch and orographic effects was introduced by inferring catchment-average \emph{P} from streamflow (\emph{Q}) observations at 13762 stations across the globe. The temporal variability of MSWEP was determined by weighted averaging of \emph{P} anomalies from seven datasets; two based solely on interpolation of gauge observations (CPC Unified and GPCC), three on satellite remote sensing (CMORPH, GSMaP-MVK, and TMPA 3B42RT), and two on atmospheric model reanalysis (ERA-Interim and JRA-55). For each grid cell, the weight assigned to the gauge-based estimates was calculated from the gauge network density, while the weights assigned to the satellite- and reanalysis-based estimates were calculated from their comparative performance at the surrounding gauges. The quality of MSWEP was compared against four state-of-the-art gauge-adjusted \emph{P} datasets (WFDEI-CRU, GPCP-1DD, TMPA 3B42, and CPC Unified) using independent \emph{P} data from 125 FLUXNET tower stations around the globe. MSWEP obtained the highest daily correlation coefficient (\emph{R}) among the five \emph{P} datasets for 60.0\% of the stations and a median \emph{R} of 0.67 vs. 0.44\&ndash;0.59 for the other datasets. We further evaluated the performance of MSWEP using hydrological modeling for 9011 catchments (\&lt;50000km\textsuperscript{2}) across the globe. Specifically, we calibrated the simple conceptual hydrological model HBV (Hydrologiska Byr\aa ns Vattenbalansavdelning) against daily \emph{Q} observations with \emph{P} from each of the different datasets. For the 1058 sparsely gauged catchments, representative of 83.9\% of the global land surface (excluding Antarctica), MSWEP obtained a median calibration NSE of 0.52 vs. 0.29\&ndash;0.39 for the other \emph{P} datasets.

  abstract = {Satellites and several specially equipped scientific aircraft provide basin-wide altimetric measurements of sea ice freeboard, from which sea ice thickness can be estimated. Up to now, few methods have been developed to use these measurements to quantitatively assess the skill of predictive models of sea ice for the Arctic. This thesis addresses this problem, using measured freeboard from ICESat and Operation IceBridge (OIB). Output from the Regional Arctic System Model (RASM) is used to demonstrate applicability of both variance- and correlation-weighted skill scores of freeboard that quantify model skill and take measurement error into account. The techniques are demonstrated using two different RASM configurations, one using Elastic-Viscous-Plastic (EVP) ice mechanics, the other using the Elastic- Anisotropic-Plastic (EAP) rheology, both simulated for 2004 and 2007, during which ICESat was in operation. RASM variance skill scores ranged from 0.712 to 0.824 and correlation skill scores were between 0.319 and 0.511. The skill scores were calculated for monthly periods and require little adaption to be applicable for monthly to decadal Navy forecasts of the Arctic. This will help improve sea ice prediction by quantifying model limitations and thus maximize the usefulness of ICESat-2 freeboard measurements after that satellite is launched next year.},

Few studies have quantified the impact of both climate change and land cover disturbances on water balances on the basin scale, and none on the regional scale. In this work, we evaluate the impacts of forest disturbances and climate change on a headwater basin to the Colorado River, the San Juan River watershed, using a robustly calibrated (Nash\textendash Sutcliffe efficiency 0.76) hydrologic model run with updated formulations that improve estimates of evapotranspiration for semi-arid regions. Our results show that future disturbances will have a substantial impact on streamflow with implications for water resource management. Our findings are in contradiction with conventional thinking that forest disturbances reduce evapotranspiration and increase streamflow. In this study, annual average regional streamflow under the coupled climate\textendash disturbance scenarios is at least 6\textendash 11\&amp;thinsp;\% lower than those scenarios accounting for climate change alone; for forested zones of the San Juan River basin, streamflow is 15\textendash 21\&amp;thinsp;\% lower. The monthly signals of altered streamflow point to an emergent streamflow pattern related to changes in forests of the disturbed systems. Exacerbated reductions of mean and low flows under disturbance scenarios indicate a high risk of low water availability for forested headwater systems of the Colorado River basin. These findings also indicate that explicit representation of land cover disturbances is required in modeling efforts that consider the impact of climate change on water resources.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {In addition to influencing climatic conditions directly through radiative forcing, increasing carbon dioxide concentration influences the climate system through its effects on plant physiology1. Plant stomata generally open less widely under increased carbon dioxide concentration2, which reduces transpiration1,3,4,5,6 and thus leaves more water at the land surface7. This driver of change in the climate system, which we term `physiological forcing', has been detected in observational records of increasing average continental runoff over the twentieth century8. Here we use an ensemble of experiments with a global climate model that includes a vegetation component to assess the contribution of physiological forcing to future changes in continental runoff, in the context of uncertainties in future precipitation. We find that the physiological effect of doubled carbon dioxide concentrations on plant transpiration increases simulated global mean runoff by 6 per cent relative to pre-industrial levels; an increase that is comparable to that simulated in response to radiatively forced climate change (11 {$\pm$} 6 per cent). Assessments of the effect of increasing carbon dioxide concentrations on the hydrological cycle that only consider radiative forcing9,10,11 will therefore tend to underestimate future increases in runoff and overestimate decreases. This suggests that freshwater resources may be less limited than previously assumed under scenarios of future global warming, although there is still an increased risk of drought. Moreover, our results highlight that the practice of assessing the climate-forcing potential of all greenhouse gases in terms of their radiative forcing potential relative to carbon dioxide does not accurately reflect the relative effects of different greenhouse gases on freshwater resources.},

  abstract = {The Global Reservoir and Lake Monitor (GRLM) records variations in surface water height for approximately 70 lakes and reservoirs worldwide using a combination of satellite radar altimetry data sets. The project was initiated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) in cooperation with the National Aeronautic and Space Administration's (NASA) Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) and the University of Maryland (UMD). On-line since the end of 2003, the program focuses on the delivery of near-real-time products within an operational framework and exists within the USDA's decision support system (DSS) through the larger cooperative USDA/NASA Global Agricultural Monitoring (GLAM) program. Currently, near-real-time products are derived from the NASA/Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) Jason-1 mission (post-2002) with archival products derived from the NASA/CNES TOPEX/Poseidon mission (1992\textendash 2002) and the US Naval Research Lab's (NRL) Geosat follow-on (GFO) mission (2000\textendash 2008). Validation exercises show that the products vary in accuracy from a few centimeters RMS (root mean square) to several tens of centimeters RMS depending on the target size and surface wave conditions. On a weekly basis, new satellite data are retrieved and products updated. Output is in the form of graphs and text files with web links to other imaging and information resources. The next phase of the program sees an expansion to over 500 lakes and reservoirs via the incorporation of products derived from the European Space Agency (ESA) remote sensing satellites (ERS-1 and ERS-2, 1992\textendash 2008) and the ESA environmental satellite ENVISAT (post-2002). Near-real-time products will also be continued via data from the follow-on Jason-2 mission (post-2009). The USDA/FAS utilize the products for irrigation potential considerations and as general indicators of drought and high-water conditions. The monitoring system thus has relevance to water resources management and agriculture efficiency at both the national and international level.},

  abstract = {Recently, we have used automated procedures to develop simple, yet accurate, ways to create runoff contour maps. Our goal was to produce maps as accurate as those now produced by manual methods. We developed eight procedures based on simple water balance methods and regression techniques to produce a map for our test case, Water-Year 1984 for the northeastern United States. Our maps are produced by linear interpolation of (1) gaged runoff at watershed centroids, and (2) runoff estimated at a set of geographic locations (precipitation stations) via each of the eight procedures. We evaluated the maps both qualitatively and quantitatively. We visually compared the automated procedure maps with a manual map produced by the U.S. Geological Survey. In general, visual agreement was very good. We then statistically compared the estimated runoff at the precipitation stations with values interpolated from the manual map. Comparing simple mean runoff, we found that two of the automated procedures gave the best results when compared with the manual map (MAN84; mean annual runoff = 84.0 cm). One method used gauged runoff values only (GAGE84; mean annual runoff = 83.3 cm) and the other used Water-Year 1984 mean regional runoff-to-precipitation ratios (MN84RP; meanannualrunoff = 82.9 cm). Because of the over-generalized appearance of the GAGE84 map compared with the manual map, we preferred the MN84RP method. Next, we performed an uncertainty analysis for five of our eight procedures. In this analysis, we withheld gauged data in the production of the maps and then compared these data with interpolated values from the maps that were produced. The MN84RP procedure and a procedure using a regression approach (REG\_\_R) had the lowest mean interpolation error. We determined that these two procedures, MN84RP and REG\_\_R, produce the most accurate maps on a regional basis and compare favorably with the manual map (i.e. mean interpolation errors of - 1.8\% and -0.7\% vs. the manual method mean error of 0.9\%). The results of our work indicate that simple automated procedures can produce runoff contour maps with regional accuracies roughly equivalent to those produced by manual methods.},

Few studies, however, have attempted to estimate the magnitude of discharge in rivers entirely from remotely obtained information. The present study uses multiple-regression analyses of hydraulic data from more than 1000 discharge measurements, ranging in magnitude from over 200,000 to less than 1 m3/s, to develop multi-variate river discharge estimating equations that use various combinations of potentially observable variables to estimate river discharge. Uncertainty analysis indicates that existing satellite-based sensors can measure water-surface width (or surface area), water-surface elevation, and potentially the surface velocity of rivers with accuracies sufficient to provide estimates of discharge with average uncertainty of less than 20\%. Development and validation of multi-variate rating equations that are applicable to the full range of rivers that can be observed from satellite sensors, development of techniques to accurately estimate the average depth in rivers from stage measurements, and development of techniques to accurately estimate the average velocity in rivers from surface-velocity measurements will be key to successful prediction of discharge from satellite observations.},

  abstract = {This review provides an overview of prey preferences of seven core Arctic marine mammal species (AMM) and four non-core species on a pan-Arctic scale with regional examples. Arctic marine mammal species exploit prey resources close to the sea ice, in the water column, and at the sea floor, including lipid-rich pelagic and benthic crustaceans and pelagic and ice-associated schooling fishes such as capelin and Arctic cod. Prey preferred by individual species range from cephalopods and benthic bivalves to Greenland halibut. A few AMM are very prey-, habitat-, and/or depth-specific (e.g., walrus, polar bear), while others are rather opportunistic and, therefore, likely less vulnerable to change (e.g., beluga, bearded seal). In the second section, we review prey distribution patterns and current biomass hotspots in the three major physical realms (sea ice, water column, and seafloor), highlighting relations to environmental parameters such as advection patterns and the sea ice regime. The third part of the contribution presents examples of documented changes in AMM prey distribution and biomass and, subsequently, suggests three potential scenarios of large-scale biotic change, based on published observations and predictions of environmental change. These scenarios discuss (1) increased pelagic primary and, hence, secondary production, particularly in the central Arctic, during open-water conditions in the summer (based on surplus nutrients currently unutilized); (2) reduced benthic and pelagic biomass in coastal/shelf areas (due to increased river runoff and, hence, changed salinity and turbidity conditions); and (3) increased pelagic grazing and recycling in open-water conditions at the expense of the current tight benthic\textendash pelagic coupling in part of the ice-covered shelf regions (due to increased pelagic consumption vs. vertical flux). Should those scenarios hold true, pelagic-feeding and generalist AMM might be advantaged, while the range for benthic shelf-feeding, ice-dependent AMM such as walrus would decrease. New pelagic feeding grounds may open up to AMM and subarctic marine mammal species in the High Arctic basins while nearshore waters might provide less abundant food in the future.},

Plans to protect and restore the coast call for diversions of the Mississippi River, and its associated sediment, to sustain and build new land2,3. However, the sediment load of the Mississippi River has been reduced by 50\% through dam construction in the Mississippi Basin, which could affect the effectiveness of diversion plans4,5,6. Here we calculate the amount of sediment stored on the delta plain for the past 12,000 years, and find that mean storage rates necessary to construct the flood plain and delta over this period exceed modern Mississippi River sediment loads. We estimate that, in the absence of sediment input, an additional 10,000\textendash 13,500 km2 will be submerged by the year 2100 owing to subsidence and sea-level rise. Sustaining existing delta surface area would require 18\textendash 24 billion tons of sediment, which is significantly more than can be drawn from the Mississippi River in its current state. We conclude that significant drowning is inevitable, even if sediment loads are restored, because sea level is now rising at least three times faster than during delta-plain construction.},

Rising concentrations of carbon dioxide are expected to affect the hydrological cycle through increases in global mean temperature and the water vapour content of the atmosphere2,3,4. However, regional precipitation changes also closely depend on the atmospheric circulation, which is expected to weaken in a warmer world4,5,6. Here, we assess the effect of a rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations on tropical circulation and precipitation by analysing results from a suite of simulations from multiple state-of-the-art climate models, and an operational numerical weather prediction model. In a scenario in which humans continue to use fossil fuels unabated, about half the tropical circulation change projected by the end of the twenty-first century, and consequently a large fraction of the regional precipitation change, is independent of global surface warming. Instead, these robust circulation and precipitation changes are a consequence of the weaker net radiative cooling of the atmosphere associated with higher atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, which affects the strength of atmospheric vertical motions. This implies that geo-engineering schemes aimed at reducing global warming without removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere would fail to fully mitigate precipitation changes in the tropics. Strategies that may help constrain rainfall projections are suggested.},

  abstract = {Permafrost is a defining characteristic of the Arctic environment. However, climate warming is thawing permafrost in many areas leading to failures in soil structure called thermokarst. An extensive survey of a 600 km2 area in and around the Toolik Lake Natural Research Area (TLNRA) revealed at least 34 thermokarst features, two thirds of which were new since {$\surd\cent$}\`A\"U{$\lnot$}\textordmasculine 1980 when a high resolution aerial survey of the area was done. Most of these thermokarst features were associated with headwater streams or lakes. We have measured significantly increased sediment and nutrient loading from thermokarst features to streams in two well-studied locations near the TLNRA. One small thermokarst gully that formed in 2003 on the Toolik River in a 0.9 km2 subcatchment delivered more sediment to the river than is normally delivered in 18 years from 132 km2 in the adjacent upper Kuparuk River basin (a long-term monitoring reference site). Ammonium, nitrate, and phosphate concentrations downstream from a thermokarst feature on Imnavait Creek increased significantly compared to upstream reference concentrations and the increased concentrations persisted over the period of sampling (1999{$\surd\cent$},\c{C}\textasciidieresis,\"A\'u2005). The downstream concentrations were similar to those we have used in a long-term experimental manipulation of the Kuparuk River and that have significantly altered the structure and function of that river. A subsampling of other thermokarst features from the extensive regional survey showed that concentrations of ammonium, nitrate, and phosphate were always higher downstream of the thermokarst features. Our previous research has shown that even minor increases in nutrient loading stimulate primary and secondary production. However, increased sediment loading could interfere with benthic communities and change the responses to increased nutrient delivery. Although the terrestrial area impacted by thermokarsts is limited, the aquatic habitat altered by these failures can be extensive. If warming in the Arctic foothills accelerates thermokarst formation, there may be substantial and wide-spread impacts on arctic stream ecosystems that are currently poorly understood.},

Direct observations further show systematically larger (smaller) runoff than precipitation increases (decreases). This result is partly attributable to uncertainties and systematic bias in precipitation observations, but still indicates that some of the observed increase in Arctic river runoff is due to water storage changes, for example melting permafrost and/or groundwater storage changes, within the drainage basins. Such causes of runoff change affect sea level, in addition to ocean salinity, and inland water resources, ecosystems, and infrastructure. Process-based hydrological modeling and observations, which can resolve changes in evapotranspiration, and groundwater and permafrost storage at and below river basin scales, are needed in order to accurately interpret and translate climate-driven precipitation changes to changes in freshwater cycling and runoff. In contrast to this need, our results show that the density of Arctic runoff monitoring has become increasingly biased and less relevant by decreasing most and being lowest in river basins with the largest expected climatic changes.},

  abstract = {Terrestrial hydrology is central to the Arctic system and its freshwater circulation. Water transport and water constituents vary, however, across a very diverse geography. In this paper, which is a component of the Arctic Freshwater Synthesis, we review the central freshwater processes in the terrestrial Arctic drainage and how they function and change across seven hydrophysiographical regions (Arctic tundra, boreal plains, shield, mountains, grasslands, glaciers/ice caps, and wetlands). We also highlight links between terrestrial hydrology and other components of the Arctic freshwater system. In terms of key processes, snow cover extent and duration is generally decreasing on a pan-Arctic scale, but snow depth is likely to increase in the Arctic tundra. Evapotranspiration will likely increase overall, but as it is coupled to shifts in landscape characteristics, regional changes are uncertain and may vary over time. Streamflow will generally increase with increasing precipitation, but high and low flows may decrease in some regions. Continued permafrost thaw will trigger hydrological change in multiple ways, particularly through increasing connectivity between groundwater and surface water and changing water storage in lakes and soils, which will influence exchange of moisture with the atmosphere. Other effects of hydrological change include increased risks to infrastructure and water resource planning, ecosystem shifts, and growing flows of water, nutrients, sediment, and carbon to the ocean. Coordinated efforts in monitoring, modeling, and processing studies at various scales are required to improve the understanding of change, in particular at the interfaces between hydrology, atmosphere, ecology, resources, and oceans.},

Some adaptation measures that have been effective in the past, most importantly large additions to reservoir storage, have little promise. Other major adaptations commonly used in the past, especially instream flow removals and groundwater mining, can substantially lower shortages but have serious external costs. If those costs are to be avoided, transfers from irrigated agriculture probably will be needed and could be substantial.},

The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of DEM resolution (from 5 to 90 m) on the delineation process of a SWAT model with two types of watershed characteristics (flat area and mountain area) and three sizes of watershed area (about 20,000, 200,000, and 1,500,000 hectares). The results showed that the total lengths of the streamline, main channel slope, watershed area, and area slope were significantly different when using the DEM datasets to delineate. Delineation using the SRTM DEM (90 m), ASTER DEM (30 m), and LDD DEM (5 m) for all watershed characteristics showed that the watershed sizes and shapes obtained were only slightly different, whereas the area slopes obtained were significantly different. The total lengths of the generated streams increased when the resolution of the DEM used was higher. The stream slopes obtained using the small area sizes were insignificant, whereas the slopes obtained using the large area sizes were significantly different. This suggests that water resource model users should use the ASTER DEM as opposed to a finer resolution DEM for model input to save time for the model calibration and validation.},

This paper investigates sediment yields from individual bank erosion events within the upper River Severn, UK (basin area 380 km2). Manual erosion pins and photo-electronic erosion pins were used to estimate bank erosion, and turbidity meters were used to determine suspended sediment transport. At the annual time-scale, the silt-clay fraction of bank-derived sediment accounted for an equivalent of 17 per cent of the suspended load, increasing to an average of 38 per cent at the monthly timescale, and then to an average of 64 per cent at the event timescale. This research highlighted that for an upland catchment, bank erosion was an important supply of suspended sediment, and that for some flood events bank erosion can supply more sediment than is transported. \^A 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

GCAM is a market equilibrium model, is global in scope, and operates from 1990 to 2100 in 5-year time steps. It can be used to examine, for example, how changes in population, income, or technology cost might alter crop production, energy demand, or water withdrawals, or how changes in one region's demand for energy affect energy, water, and land in other regions. This paper describes the model, including its assumptions, inputs, and outputs. We then use 11 scenarios, varying the socioeconomic and climate policy assumptions, to illustrate the results from the model. The resulting scenarios demonstrate a wide range of potential future energy, water, and land uses. We compare the results from GCAM v5.1 to historical data and to future scenario simulations from earlier versions of GCAM and from other models. Finally, we provide information on how to obtain the model.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

However, there has been limited discussion on their mechanisms of formation and relation to other hillslope process such as slope stability and the development of preferential flow pathways. On an organic-covered permafrost-underlain subarctic slope in Yukon Territory, Canada, pipe formation and development processes were studied in an attempt to ascertain their larger role in the hillslope hydrogeomorphic framework. Pipes are widespread on the study slope, conveying water during the snowmelt period when the water table is at or near the surface. During snowmelt, excess pore pressures generated at the heterogeneous thaw front reduce soil strength, increasing the potential for thaw-zone detachment failures. Upon failure, seepage erosion at the interface between organic and mineral soils induces pipe formation. Pipes, which are closely associated with rills and other zones of preferential flow, then become integrated into the larger hillslope drainage network. Drainage within preferential flow pathways advects heat, leading to local increases in thaw and encouraging ground subsidence where the permafrost is ice-rich. In this way, a positive-feedback occurs whereby preferential flow pathways reinforce their influence on the drainage network through subsidence.},

  abstract = {Perhaps more than in any other ocean, our understanding of the continental shelves of the Arctic Mediterranean is decidedly disciplinary, regional and fractured, and this shortcoming must be addressed if we are to face and prepare for climate change. A fundamental flaw is that while excellent process studies exist, and while recent ship-based expeditions have added greatly to our collective body of knowledge, an integrated and fully pan-Arctic perspective on the structure and function of food webs on Arctic shelves is lacking. Based on the collective overviews given in Progress in Oceanography xx, xx\textendash xx, we attempt to address this issue. To build a perspective that inter-connects the various shelf regions we suggest three unifying typologies affecting food webs that will hopefully allow inter-comparison of regional investigations. The first is for shelf geography, wherein shelves are classified according to their role in the Arctic throughflow. The second is for ice climate, wherein the various ice regimes are examined for their specific impacts on food web dynamics. The third is for stratification where it is argued that the source of buoyancy, thermal or haline, impacts production and the vertical carbon flux. We then address the connection between physical habitat and biota on pan-Arctic (and global climate) scales. This discussion begins with the recognition that the Arctic Ocean is integral to the World Ocean via its thermohaline (``estuarine'') exchanges with the Atlantic and Pacific. As such the Arctic and its shelves act as a double estuary, wherein incoming waters become both lighter (positive estuary), by mixing with freshwater sources, and heavier (negative estuary) by cooling and brine release. Shelves are central to such transformations. This complex interconnectivity coupling of the Arctic Ocean to its sub-Arctic (and more productive) neighbors demands that food webs be considered through a macroecological view that includes an ecology of advection. We argue that the macroecological view is required if we are to understand and model food webs under forcing along climate gradients. To aid this effort we introduce the concept of contiguous domains, wherein physical habitats are joined by common features that will allow inter-comparisons of existing and future food webs over large scales and climatic gradients. Finally, we speculate on the range of possible futures for Arctic shelves based on the palaeo-record.},

The sensitivity of the RASM near-surface climate to changes in atmosphere, ocean, and sea ice parameters and physics is evaluated in four simulations. The near-surface atmospheric circulation is well simulated in all four RASM simulations but biases in surface temperature are caused by biases in downward surface radiative fluxes. Errors in radiative fluxes are due to biases in simulated clouds with different versions of RASM simulating either too much or too little cloud radiative impact over open ocean regions and all versions simulating too little cloud radiative impact over land areas. Cold surface temperature biases in the central Arctic in winter are likely due to too few or too radiatively thin clouds. The precipitation simulated by RASM is sensitive to changes in evaporation that were linked to sea surface temperature biases. Future work will explore changes in model microphysics aimed at minimizing the cloud and radiation biases identified in this work.},

Is sustainability a realistic goal in a world in which many key process controls are directionally changing? To address this issue, we integrate several disparate sources of theory to address sustainability in directionally changing social\textendash ecological systems, apply this framework to climate-warming impacts in Interior Alaska, and describe a suite of policy strategies that emerge from these analyses. Climate warming in Interior Alaska has profoundly affected factors that influence landscape processes (climate regulation and disturbance spread) and natural hazards, but has only indirectly influenced ecosystem goods such as food, water, and wood that receive most management attention. Warming has reduced cultural services provided by ecosystems, leading to some of the few institutional responses that directly address the causes of climate warming, e.g., indigenous initiatives to the Arctic Council. Four broad policy strategies emerge: (i) enhancing human adaptability through learning and innovation in the context of changes occurring at multiple scales; (ii) increasing resilience by strengthening negative (stabilizing) feedbacks that buffer the system from change and increasing options for adaptation through biological, cultural, and economic diversity; (iii) reducing vulnerability by strengthening institutions that link the high-latitude impacts of climate warming to their low-latitude causes; and (iv) facilitating transformation to new, potentially more beneficial states by taking advantage of opportunities created by crisis. Each strategy provides societal benefits, and we suggest that all of them be pursued simultaneously.},

This results from the dominance of secondary remobilization of Quaternary sediments along river valleys over primary denudation of the land surface. The result controverts the conventional model which has been derived from studies of small, highly disturbed agricultural catch-ments. The rivers are still responding to the last glaciation, giving a landscape relaxation time greater than 10 kyr.

However, current large-scale land models (as a component of Earth System Models, or ESMs) do not yet reflect the best hydrologic process understanding or utilize the large amount of hydrologic observations for model testing. This paper discusses the opportunities and key challenges to improve hydrologic process representations and benchmarking in ESM land models, suggesting that (1) land model development can benefit from recent advances in hydrology, both through incorporating key processes (e.g., groundwater-surface water interactions) and new approaches to describe multiscale spatial variability and hydrologic connectivity; (2) accelerating model advances requires comprehensive hydrologic benchmarking in order to systematically evaluate competing alternatives, understand model weaknesses, and prioritize model development needs, and (3) stronger collaboration is needed between the hydrology and ESM modeling communities, both through greater engagement of hydrologists in ESM land model development, and through rigorous evaluation of ESM hydrology performance in research watersheds or Critical Zone Observatories. Such coordinated efforts in advancing hydrology in ESMs have the potential to substantially impact energy, carbon, and nutrient cycle prediction capabilities through the fundamental role hydrologic processes play in regulating these cycles.},

We measured 25 unique distributary bifurcations in an experimental delta and 197 bifurcations in 10 natural deltas, yielding a mean angle of 70.4{$\circ\pm$}2.6{$\circ$} (95\% confidence interval) for field-scale deltas and a mean angle of 68.3{$\circ\pm$}8.7{$\circ$} for the experimental delta, consistent with this theoretical prediction. The bifurcation angle holds for small scales relative to channel width length scales. Furthermore, the experimental data show that the mean angle is 72{$\circ$} immediately after bifurcation initiation and remains relatively constant over significant time scales.

Here we study changes in global riverine water discharge and suspended sediment flux over a 50-year period, 1960\textendash 2010, applying a new version of the WBMsed (WBMsed v.2.0) global hydrological water balance model. A new floodplain component is introduced to better represent water and sediment dynamics during periods of overbank discharge. Validated against data from 16 globally distributed stations, WBMsed v.2.0 simulation results show considerable improvement over the original model. Normalized departure from an annual mean is used to quantify spatial and temporal dynamics in both water discharge and sediment flux. Considerable intra-basin variability in both water and sediment discharge is observed for the first time in different regions of the world. Continental-scale analysis shows considerable variability in water and sediment discharge fluctuations both in time and between continents. A correlation analysis between predicted continental suspended sediment and water discharge shows strong correspondence in Australia and Africa (R2 of 0.93 and 0.87 respectively), moderate correlation in North and South America (R2 of 0.64 and 0.73 respectively) and weak correlation in Asia and Europe (R2 of 0.35 and 0.24 respectively). We propose that yearly changes in intra-basin precipitation dynamics explain most of these differences in continental water discharge and suspended sediment correlation. The mechanism proposed and demonstrated here (for the Ganges, Danube and Amazon Rivers) is that regions with high relief and soft lithology will amplify the effect of higher than average precipitation by producing an increase in sediment yield that greatly exceeds increase in water discharge.},

By taking published estimates of gas exchange, sediment accumulation, and carbon transport for a variety of aquatic systems, we have constructed a budget for the role of inland water ecosystems in the global carbon cycle. Our analysis conservatively estimates that inland waters annually receive, from a combination of background and anthropogenically altered sources, on the order of 1.9 Pg C y-1 from the terrestrial landscape, of which about 0.2 is buried in aquatic sediments, at least 0.8 (possibly much more) is returned to the atmosphere as gas exchange while the remaining 0.9 Pg y-1 is delivered to the oceans, roughly equally as inorganic and organic carbon. Thus, roughly twice as much C enters inland aquatic systems from land as is exported from land to the sea. Over prolonged time net carbon fluxes in aquatic systems tend to be greater per unit area than in much of the surrounding land. Although their area is small, these freshwater aquatic systems can affect regional C balances. Further, the inclusion of inland, freshwater ecosystems provides useful insight about the storage, oxidation and transport of terrestrial C, and may warrant a revision of how the modern net C sink on land is described.},

  abstract = {The Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers combined have formed one of the largest deltas in the world, comprising some 23,000 sq. miles. These rivers originate within the Himalayan Mountains and drain an enormous land area before entering East Pakistan. Individually, each of the rivers discharges in excess of 2.5 million cusecs of water during flood, and combined they carry nearly 6 million cusecs of water to the Bay of Bengal, nearly three times the amount borne by the Mississippi River. Having such a large drainage area, the rivers are also heavily charged with sediment, transporting approximately 13 million tons of suspended sediment per day during flood. The large discharge and heavy sediment load cause the rivers to be extremely unstable, and the channels are constantly migrating laterally. Within Recent times both rivers have occupied and abandoned numerous river courses. The Brahmaputra followed a route some 60 miles to the east of its present course only 200 years ago. The long-term patterns of river migration indicate that the Ganges has been migrating eastward, whereas the preferred migration of the Brahmaputra is westward. These movements are obviously controlled by major faults or fractures in the earth's crust. The Brahmaputra River displays a braided pattern in plan view, and short-term channel migration is quite drastic, with rates of movement as high as 2,600 ft. a year being common. The rate of rise and fall of the river, the number and position of major channels active during flood, the formation and movement of large bedforms, cohesion and variability in composition of bank material, and intensity of bank slumping are some of the factors responsible for controlling the bankline configuration and movement. The most significant bankline modifications take place during falling-river stage, when excess sediment is deposited as bars within the channel, causing a change in local flow direction and migration of the thalweg. Studies of bedform patterns and migration indicate that during a single flood cycle the bed configuration undergoes a definite sequence of changes. During low-river stage small bedforms (WH = 1\textendash 5 ft.) are present and migrate downstream at an average rate of 400ft./24 h. As discharge increases, the bedforms grow in size (WH = 5\textendash 20 ft.), and surface turbulence assumes a regular pattern on the water surface. During maximum-flood period some of the bedforms attain gigantic size, with heights up to 50 ft., and migrate downstream at rates as high as 2,000 ft./24 h. At other positions in the channel a plane bed exists, and surface turbulence patterns become oriented parallel to the channel axis. Although quite different in scale, this sequence is similar to that reported in flume studies. During low-river stage trenches on the various exposed bars revealed the type of bedding formed by migration of the various bedforms. Crossbedding measurements at these stations were recorded and compared to sand body trends. The combined Bengal Basin rivers deliver some 1 billion tons of suspended sediment a year to the Bay of Bengal, yet map and photo comparisons indicate that the shoreline has remained quite stable. Most of the sediment brought to the bay bypasses the bar and continues on into deeper water through a canyon called the Swatch of No Ground. Thus in deep water a subaqueous delta is being formed that dwarfs the subaerial delta, one of the largest in the world.},

The reason for the evaluation phase is that the model is to be used for the core climate simulations carried out by the Met Office Hadley Centre for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), so it is essential that addition of the extra complexity does not detract substantially from its climate performance.

These high-resolution, geospatial emissions inventories for shipping can be used to evaluate Arctic climate sensitivity to black carbon (a short-lived climate forcing pollutant especially effective in accelerating the melting of ice and snow), aerosols, and gaseous emissions including carbon dioxide. We quantify ship emissions scenarios which are expected to increase as declining sea ice coverage due to climate change allows for increased shipping activity in the Arctic. A first-order calculation of global warming potential due to 2030 emissions in the high-growth scenario suggests that short-lived forcing of \textasciitilde 4.5 gigagrams of black carbon from Arctic shipping may increase global warming potential due to Arctic ships' CO\textsubscript{2} emissions (\textasciitilde 42 000 gigagrams) by some 17\% to 78\%.

Deposition occurred where tributaries joined the main channel, across meander bends, and below valley constrictions such as roads and bridges. Despite the magnitude of the rainfall and flooding there were no slope failures in the basin. The only modifications to the watershed were observed in the lowlands along the main channels. Channel widening was the most spectacular modification. Within 1 year of the flood, channel cross sections were well along recovery toward pre-Agnes dimensions. Meandering reaches of the channel recover faster than straight reaches. The Agnes flood is nearly the largest ever reported from a Piedmont watershed of this size. Large floods in the Piedmont apparently play a minor role in shaping the landscape, whereas large floods in the Blue Ridge/Valley and Ridge and Appalachian Plateau provinces, and consequent slope failure, are very active landscaping agents.},

  abstract = {Long-term prediction of environmental response to natural and anthropogenic disturbances in a basin becomes highly uncertain using physically based distributed models, particularly when transport time scales range from tens to thousands of years, such as for sediment. Yet, such predictions are needed as changes in one part of a basin now might adversely affect other parts of the basin in years to come. In this paper, we propose a simplified network-based predictive framework of sedimentological response in a basin, which incorporates network topology, channel characteristics, and transport-process dynamics to perform a nonlinear process-based scaling of the river-network width function to a time-response function. We develop the process-scaling formulation for transport of mud, sand, and gravel, using simplifying assumptions including neglecting long-term storage, and apply the methodology to the Minnesota River Basin. We identify a robust bimodal distribution of the sedimentological response for sand of the basin which we attribute to specific source areas, and identify a resonant frequency of sediment supply where the disturbance of one area followed by the disturbance of another area after a certain period of time, may result in amplification of the effects of sediment inputs which would be otherwise difficult to predict. We perform a sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of the proposed formulation to model parameter uncertainty and use observations of suspended sediment at several stations in the basin to diagnose the model. The proposed framework has identified an important vulnerability of the Minnesota River Basin to spatial and temporal structuring of sediment delivery.},

Here, we put forward the hypothesis that places in the network predisposed (due to process dynamics and network topology) to accumulate excess sediment over a considerable river reach and over a considerable period of time reflect locations where a local imbalance in sediment flux may occur thereby highlighting a susceptibility to potential fluvial geomorphic change. We develop a dynamic connectivity framework which uses the river network structure and a simplified Lagrangian transport model to trace fluxes through the network and integrate emergent ``clusters'' through a cluster persistence index (CPI). The framework was applied to sand transport in the Greater Blue Earth River Network in the Minnesota River Basin. Three hotspots of fluvial geomorphic change were defined as locations where high rates of channel migration were observed and places of high CPI coincided with two of these hotspots of possibly sediment-driven change. The third hotspot was not identified by high CPI, but instead is believed to be a hotspot of streamflow-driven change based on additional information and the fact that high bed shear stress coincided with this hotspot. The proposed network-based dynamic connectivity framework has the potential to place dynamical processes occurring at small scales into a network context to understand how reach-scale changes cascade into network-scale effects, useful for informing the large-scale consequences of local management actions.},

Herein, we present a network-based model that quantifies nitrate-nitrogen and organic carbon concentrations through a wetland-river network and estimates nitrate export from the watershed. This model dynamically accounts for multiple competing limitations on nitrate removal, explicitly incorporates wetlands in the network, and captures hierarchical network effects and spatial interactions. We apply the model to the Le Sueur Basin, a data-rich 2,880 km2 agricultural landscape in southern Minnesota and validate the model using synoptic field measurements during June for years 2013?2015. Using the model, we show that the overall limits to nitrate removal rate via denitrification shift between nitrate concentration, organic carbon availability, and residence time depending on discharge, characteristics of the waterbody, and location in the network. Our model results show that the spatial context of wetland restorations is an important but often overlooked factor because nonlinearities in the system, e.g., deriving from switching of resource limitation on denitrification rate, can lead to unexpected changes in downstream biogeochemistry. Our results demonstrate that reduction of watershed-scale nitrate concentrations and downstream loads in the Le Sueur Basin can be most effectively achieved by increasing water residence time (by slowing the flow) rather than by increasing organic carbon concentrations (which may limit denitrification). This framework can be used toward assessing where and how to restore wetlands for reducing nitrate concentrations and loads from agricultural watersheds.},

Coastal response to major storms in 1987 and 1993 suggests that erosion is episodic, with short periods of intense disruption followed by readjustment of cliff profiles. Processes characteristic of this environment include mechanical erosion of ice-bonded sediments creating unstable erosional niches, mechanical failure of niches along ice-wedge planes, and longer term thermal erosion of ice-bonded sediments. Where ice contents are high, localized thaw slumps initiated by coastal erosion may retreat at rates substantially higher than those observed at other sections of the coast.

During the 2015 flood cycle, pCO2 varied between 5973 and 14,292 {$\mu$}atm, with pCH4 concentrations ranging between 2956 and 51,675 {$\mu$}atm respectively, with high temporal variability for both gases. The supersaturation of CO2 and CH4 in relation to the atmospheric equilibrium caused the system to behave as a net source of CO2 and CH4 to the atmosphere with evasion rates of 320 mg CO2 m-2 d-1 and 20 mg CH4 m-2 d-1, respectively. Mean DOC concentration was 7.0 {$\pm$} 0.4 mg L-1 and did not differ between flood cycles. Higher concentrations of DOC were measured at the start (rising floodwaters) and at the end (receding floodwaters) of flood cycles, while lower DOC concentrations were observed during the peak flood. The PARAFAC analysis indicated the presence of five DOM components: humic (C1 and C2) and fulvic type material (C3) showed the highest relative abundance (68.5\% of the total PARAFAC component fluorescence), as well as protein-like material (C4 and C5) derived from microorganisms. Our measured diffusive flux levels were below the range of emissions found for wetlands and floodplains for CO2, but were slightly higher for CH4 relative to other studies in lakes and seasonally flooded areas of the Pantanal. The large variations in concentrations of CO2, CH4 and DOC and the optical properties of DOM during the course of each flood cycle suggest a close relationship between carbon and water cycles in this tropical wetland.},

  abstract = {Streambank retreat can be a significant contributor to total sediment and nutrient loading to streams. Process-based bank stability models, such as the Bank Stability and Toe Erosion Model (BSTEM), have been used to determine critical factors affecting streambank erosion and failure such as riparian vegetation and to estimate retreat rates over time. BSTEM has been successfully applied on a number of cohesive streambanks, but less so on composite banks consisting of both cohesive and noncohesive soils in highly sinuous streams. Composite streambanks can exhibit rapid and episodic bank retreat. The objectives of this research were twofold: (i) develop and apply simplified procedures for estimating root cohesion based on above- and below-ground biomass estimates and (ii) systematically apply BSTEM to a series of 10 composite streambanks distributed along the Barren Fork Creek in eastern Oklahoma to assess model sensitivity to root cohesion and model performance in predicting retreat. This research aimed to document the influence of riparian conservation practices on bank retreat rates and evaluated simplistic methods for incorporating such practices into such process-based models. Sites modeled included historically unprotected sites with no riparian vegetation and historically protected sites with riparian vegetation present during all or part of the 2003 to 2010 study period. The lateral retreat ranged from 4.1 to 74.8. m across the 10 sites and was largest at the historically unprotected sites in which retreat averaged 49.2. m. Protected sites had less bank retreat but with more variability in retreat rates per year. With calibration focused on the erodibility parameters, the model was able to match both the observed total amount of retreat as well as the timing of retreat at both the protected and unprotected sites as derived from aerial imagery. During calibration BSTEM was not sensitive to the specific value of the soil cohesion or the additional soil cohesion added due to roots for the cohesive topsoil layer, suggesting that the proposed simplified techniques could be used to estimate root cohesion values. The BSTEM modeling also provided an advantageous assessment tool for evaluating retreat rates compared to in situ bank retreat measurements due to the magnitude and episodic nature of streambank erosion and failures. Process-based models, such as BSTEM, may be necessary to incrementally model bank retreat in order to quantify actual streambank retreat rates and understand mechanisms of failure for the design of stabilization projects.},

Using Sentinel-1 images from spring 2017, we discriminate between bottomfast, stabilized, and nonstabilized landfast ice over the main marginal seas of the Arctic Ocean (Beaufort, Chukchi, East Siberian, Laptev, and Kara seas). This approach draws on the evaluation of relative changes in interferometric fringe patterns. This first comprehensive assessment of Arctic bottomfast sea ice extent has revealed that most of the bottomfast sea ice is situated around river mouths and coastal shallows. The Laptev and East Siberian seas dominate the aerial extent, covering roughly 4100 and 5100\&thinsp;km\textsuperscript{2}, respectively. These seas also contain the largest extent of stabilized and nonstabilized landfast ice, but are subject to the largest uncertainties surrounding the mapping scheme. Even so, we demonstrate the potential for using InSAR for assessing the stability of landfast ice in several key regions around the Arctic, providing a new understanding of how stability may vary between regions. InSAR-derived stability may serve for strategic planning and tactical decision support for different uses of coastal ice. In a case study of the Nares Strait, we demonstrate that interferograms may reveal early-warning signals for the breakup of stationary sea ice.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The world's rivers deliver 19 billion tonnes of sediment to the coastal zone annually1, with a considerable fraction being sequestered in large deltas, home to over 500 million people. Most (more than 70 per cent) large deltas are under threat from a combination of rising sea levels, ground surface subsidence and anthropogenic sediment trapping2,3, and a sustainable supply of fluvial sediment is therefore critical to prevent deltas being `drowned' by rising relative sea levels2,3,4. Here we combine suspended sediment load data from the Mekong River with hydrological model simulations to isolate the role of tropical cyclones in transmitting suspended sediment to one of the world's great deltas. We demonstrate that spatial variations in the Mekong's suspended sediment load are correlated (r = 0.765, P {$<$} 0.1) with observed variations in tropical-cyclone climatology, and that a substantial portion (32 per cent) of the suspended sediment load reaching the delta is delivered by runoff generated by rainfall associated with tropical cyclones. Furthermore, we estimate that the suspended load to the delta has declined by 52.6 {$\pm$} 10.2 megatonnes over recent years (1981\textendash 2005), of which 33.0 {$\pm$} 7.1 megatonnes is due to a shift in tropical-cyclone climatology. Consequently, tropical cyclones have a key role in controlling the magnitude of, and variability in, transmission of suspended sediment to the coast. It is likely that anthropogenic sediment trapping in upstream reservoirs is a dominant factor in explaining past5,6,7, and anticipating future8,9, declines in suspended sediment loads reaching the world's major deltas. However, our study shows that changes in tropical-cyclone climatology affect trends in fluvial suspended sediment loads and thus are also key to fully assessing the risk posed to vulnerable coastal systems.},

Field data are becoming more available, but at the same time PAR is rapidly changing. Biogeochemical models can provide the means to capture some of these changes. This study introduces and synthesizes ecosystem modeling in PAR by discussing differences in complexity and application of one-dimensional, regional, and global earth system models. Topics include the general structure of ecosystem models and specifics of the combined benthic, pelagic, and ice PAR ecosystems, the importance of model validation, model responses to climate influences (e.g. diminishing sea ice, ocean acidification), and the impacts of circulation and stratification changes on PAR ecosystems and biogeochemical cycling. Examples of modeling studies that help place the region within the context of the Pan-Arctic System are also discussed. We synthesize past and ongoing PAR biogeochemical modeling efforts and briefly touch on decision makers' use of ecosystem models and on necessary future developments.},

A study on bank erosion and channel migration of the present course of the Khowai River through the synclinal valley of Atharamura and Baramura Hill Ranges indicates that the area is under active erosion since long back. In this study, the rate of channel migration has been assessed and variation of sinuosity index and radius of curvature have also been calculated. The study of the active channel width and channel position from 1975 to 2014 indicates that a large portion of land along both the banks of the Khowai River has already been eroded away. This work also documented land use changes in its surrounding flood plain area using supervised image classification. Overall accuracy of the land use classification ranges between 88\% and 93\%. The whole study is being done utilising the remote sensing imagery (2014), SOI topographical map (1975) and GIS technology. The land use classification shows that there is an increase in built up area and decrease in net sown area. The channel migration directly affects the land use and land use change has direct effect on the flood plain dwellers of the study area. All the assessments of this study highlight a significant message of immense vulnerability of Khowai River and also provide news about geomorphological instabilities of the study area.},

Both swamps had little influence on the regulation or attenuation of seasonal runoff response in the catchment. The two valley bottom swamps were connected to local aquifers but the upland-wetland connection was continuous in the catchment with deeper till and ephemeral in the catchment with thin till-rock ridges. Groundwater movement through the wetlands was restricted mainly to the surface peat layer in both wetlands, because a large portion of inputs from shallow soil layers and stream inflows enter near the peat surface. However, differences in upland-wetland connections resulted in contrasting hydrologic regimes in the two swamps. During seasons with larger inputs, both swamps were hydrologically connected to uplands and had a similar hydrology characterized by a high water table, rapid storm response, and predominance of saturated overland flow. In summer, upland inputs were absent in the catchment with thin till-rock ridges, resulting in cessation of baseflow and a lower water table that varied in response to variations in rainfall. Continuous upland inputs throughout the summer in the catchment with deeper tills (1,\"A\`i3 m) sustained baseflow and kept the water table near the peat surface. This study demonstrates the control of morphology and shallow subsurface geology on the hydrology of valley bottom swamps influenced by local aquifers.},

The estimates made during August\textendash September were based on both deployments of an automated in situ benthic flux chamber tripod and on pore water chemical profiles from cores analyzed aboard the R/V Alpha Helix. Wintertime observations were obtained using scaled-down versions of the in situ flux chamber that were deployed through land-fast ice. The results of these determinations suggested that there was no drastic decrease in shelf denitrification rates at the end of winter off Pt. Barrow despite the fact that a supply of ``new'' organic material to the sediments via primary production had not occurred for several months. In addition, the ensemble of our data suggest appreciable year-round average rates ({$\sim$} 1 mg-atom N2 m-2 day-1) that fall within the range of modern estimates for moderately productive mid-latitude shelf regions, and are about 40\% as high as values reported for the Washington (NE Pacific) shelf. The results have some significance for understanding the oceanic combined nitrogen budget because denitrification in shallow and hemipelagic sediments is a major loss term and because the Arctic Ocean and its marginal and adjacent seas (such as the Bering Sea) contain 25\% of the ocean's shelf sediments and 14\% of the ocean sediments with depths between 0.2\textendash 1 km, despite the fact that this region accounts for only 4\% of the total oceanic surface area.},

  abstract = {The Ganga/Ganges1is an important river system in South Asia which supports the life and livelihoods of millions of people both in India and Bangladesh. The system has a number of names throughout its length. Below its confluence with the Brahmaputra at Aricha it is known as the Padma, which in turn merges with the Upper Meghna at Chandpur below which the channel is known as the Lower Meghna. There is a growing concern about this large river system because its channels are subject to frequent migration, threatening engineering structures and resulting in various environmental and social consequences which may be compounded by climatic variability, land use change, and agricultural intensification as the basin experiences rapid population growth. Concerns have been expressed that the construction of a barrage just upstream of the Indo\textendash Bangladesh border has adversely affected the Ganges reach in Bangladesh. Partly in order to investigate this, the planform changes of the Ganges and the Padma within Bangladesh was analysed over the period 1973 to 2011 using multitemporal Landsat images and long\textendash term flow data in eight epochs with an average duration of 4.5 years. The Padma reach is less affected by the barrage and provides a useful control study. Areas of erosion and deposition were determined from sequential changes in the bankline positions. Mean channel width, sinuosity and braiding index were analysed using a Geographic Information System (GIS). Flood frequency, duration and magnitudes were studied using long-term discharge records. Generally, channel planform evaluation indicated that both the Ganges and the Padma experienced contraction, expansion and readjustment in configuration over the last 38 years. Erosion and deposition statistics of the Ganges indicate that 57 km2of land was lost along the right bank whereas around 59 km2has been gained along the left bank during the assessment period, suggesting that the erosion and accretion of both banks is roughly balanced with a general movement towards the right bank. The width of the Ganges varied from a maximum of 5.36 to a minimum of 3.23 km during the observation period. Changes to sandbar area are, in general, much more radical than changes to the overall width and area of the channel. Measurement of areas of erosion and accretion showed that both banks of the Padma experienced considerable loss of land. The total net loss for left bank and right bank was 155 and 28 km2, respectively. The Padma is approximately twice the width of the Ganges and the changes to its channel area are not as temporally dynamic as the Ganges. The relationship between bank curvature and erosion/accretion of the river banks for both rivers was analysed and the results contradict established meander theory. Regression analysis between bank erosion rates, annual average discharge and mean flood flow data showed that bank erosion was significantly correlated with annual average discharge for the Padma (r2 = 0.6283) and that the Ganges bank erosion rate is influenced by mean flood flow (r2 = 0.6738). The flood frequency shows generally good stability across the first eight of the nine epochs for the Ganges but for the Padma the frequency showed even greater stability. We were unable to support the widely held belief that the upstream barrage has a deleterious effect on the Ganges but note that there is a slight effect due to the periodic release of sediment through scour sluices.},

While interference typically decreases with increasing habitat complexity, it often increases with increasing size differences among individuals. However, little is known about how variation in intrinsic factors such as population size structure alters predator\textendash prey interactions and how this intrinsic variation interacts with extrinsic variation. 2. By experimentally varying the level of vegetation cover and the size structure of the predatory damselfly Ischnura posita Hagen, we examined the individual and interactive effects of variation in habitat complexity and predator size structure on prey mortality. 3. Copepod prey survival linearly increased as the I. posita size ratio decreased and differed by up to 31\% among different predator size structures. Size classes had an additive effect on prey survival, most likely because intraspecific aggression appeared size-independent and size classes differed in microhabitat preference: large I. posita spent 14\% more time foraging on the floor than small larvae and spent more time in the vegetation with increasing habitat complexity. Despite this difference in microhabitat use among size classes, habitat structure did not influence predation rates or interference among size classes. 4. In general, results suggest that seasonal and spatial variation in the size structure of populations could drive some of the discrepancies in predator-mediated prey suppression observed in nature, and this variation could exceed the effects of variation in habitat structure.},

Such laws are a compromise between physics-based theory that requires extensive information about materials and their interactions, which may be hard to quantify across real landscapes, and rules-based approaches, which cannot be tested directly but only can be used in models to see if the model outcomes match some expected or observed state. We propose that landscape evolution modeling can be broadly categorized into detailed, apparent, statistical and essential realism models and it is the latter, concerned with explaining mechanistically the essential morphodynamic features of a landscape, in which geomorphic transport laws are most effectively applied. A limited number of studies have provided verification and parameterization of geomorphic transport laws for: linear slope-dependent transport, non-linear transport due to dilational disturbance of soil, soil production from bedrock, and river incision into bedrock. Field parameterized geomorphic transport laws, however, are lacking for many processes including landslides, debris flows, surface wash, and glacial scour. We propose the use of high- resolution topography, as initial conditions, in landscape evolution models and explore the applicability of locally parameterized geomorphic transport laws in explaining hillslope morphology in the Oregon Coast Range. This modeling reveals unexpected morphodynamics, suggesting that the use of real landscapes with geomorphic transport laws may provide new insights about the linkages between process and form.},

  abstract = {In the western Tauride belt of southern Turkey, a north pointing cusp (Isparta Angle) occurs along the Mesozoic carbonate axis and encompasses passive continental margin sequences, rift assemblages, mantle peridotites, an ophiolite complex, and platform fragments. The contacts between these tectonostratigraphic units are commonly tectonic with the carbonate platforms forming the autochthonous basement to the west and east directed thrust sheets both in the west and the east. Rift assemblages consist of chert, pelagic limestone, mudstone, sandstone, and alkaline lavas ranging in age from Upper Triassic to Upper Cretaceous and locally include serpentinite lenses. Mantle peridotites are commonly harzburgitic, cut by numerous doleritic dikes, and underlain by a syntectonic m\'elange. The ophiolite complex occurs in the south, adjacent to and overlying the western platform (Bey Daglari), and consits mainly of peridotites and cumulate gabbros with a poorly developed dike complex and rare extrusive rocks. Platform fragments are represented by north-south trending slivers of limestones that have affinity with the western platform. They are technically overlain by the rift assemblages and/or mantle rocks within the Isparta Angle. Rock types and associated structures within the Isparta Angle indicate a progressive evolution from continental rifting and passive margin development to ocean basin formation in the Tauride belt of the Neotethyan realm during Triassic to Late Cretaceous time. The pronounced asymmetry in the crustal architecture of the conjugate margins suggests that initial stages of rifting and subsequent extension were probably facilitated by crustal failure along an east dipping (in present coordinates) low-angle fault. Continued rifting and associated crustal thinning resulted in upwelling and emplacement of the mantle beneath the lower plate and in partial melting of this elevated mantle generating alkaline lavas. Further extension in the south established a spreading system along which Cretaceous oceanic crust, now represented by the Tekirova ophiolite, was created. Contractional deformation in Late Cretaceous to Late Tertiary time caused telescoping of rock units within the Isparta Angle and emplacement of thrust sheets onto the platform carbonates both in the east and the west. The opening and closure stages of the ocean basin within the Isparta Angle were diachronous while the bounding carbonate platforms were probably revolved around a pivoting pole located at or near the apex of this sharp bend in the Tauride belt.

  abstract = {Observational and modeling studies are conducted to explore the changing physical environment of the western Arctic Ocean and its significance to upper-ocean hydrography and acoustic energy propagation. In-situ observations of temperature and salinity were made as part of the Canada Basin Acoustic Propagation Experiment (CANAPE) pilot study in summer 2015. Sound-speed fluctuations due to internal waves and spice were analyzed to describe spatio-temporal variability. Internal-wave frequency spectra show a spectral slope lower than the Garrett-Munk (GM) model, and the energy level is 4\% of the standard GM value. Frequency spectra of spice show a form similar to the internal-wave spectra but with a steeper spectral slope. Several global climate models were evaluated against historical and recent hydrographic observations and found to inadequately represent key upper-ocean hydrographic features. The Regional Arctic System Model (RASM) was used to investigate sensitivity of the simulated upper ocean to various configurations and showed that sub-grid scale brine rejection parameterization, appropriately tuned surface momentum coupling, and increased vertical and horizontal resolution improved model simulation. In both observational and model data sets, a near-surface sound channel is present, the significance and variability of which warrant further in-situ investigations and model improvements.},

The European Space Agency\&rsquo;s (ESA\&rsquo;s) Microwave Imaging Radiometer using Aperture Synthesis (MIRAS), onboard the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity mission (SMOS), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration\&rsquo;s (NASA\&rsquo;s) Aquarius and Soil Moisture Active Passive mission (SMAP) use L-band radiometry to measure SSS. There are notable differences in the instrumental approaches, as well as in the retrieval algorithms. We compare the salinity retrieved from these three spaceborne sensors to in situ observations from the Argo network of drifting floats, and we analyze some possible causes for the differences. We present comparisons of the long-term global spatial distribution, the temporal variability for a set of regions of interest and statistical distributions. We analyze some of the possible causes for the differences between the various satellite SSS products by reprocessing the retrievals from Aquarius brightness temperatures changing the model for the sea water dielectric constant and the ancillary product for the sea surface temperature. We quantify the impact of these changes on the differences in SSS between Aquarius and SMOS. We also identify the impact of the corrections for atmospheric effects recently modified in the Aquarius SSS retrievals. All three satellites exhibit SSS errors with a strong dependence on sea surface temperature, but this dependence varies significantly with the sensor. We show that these differences are first and foremost due to the dielectric constant model, then to atmospheric corrections and to a lesser extent to the ancillary product of the sea surface temperature.},

  abstract = {Channel bifurcations control the distribution of water and sediment in deltas, and the routing of these materials facilitates land building in coastal regions. Yet few practical methods exist to provide accurate predictions of flow partitioning at multiple bifurcations within a distributary channel network. Herein, multiple nodal relations that predict flow partitioning at individual bifurcations, utilizing various hydraulic and channel planform parameters, are tested against field data collected from the Selenga River delta, Russia. The data set includes 2.5 months of time-continuous, synoptic measurements of water and sediment discharge partitioning covering a flood hydrograph. Results show that width, sinuosity, and bifurcation angle are the best remotely sensed, while cross-sectional area and flow depth are the best field measured nodal relation variables to predict flow partitioning. These nodal relations are incorporated into a graph model, thus developing a generalized framework that predicts partitioning of water discharge and total, suspended, and bedload sediment discharge in deltas. Results from the model tested well against field data produced for the Wax Lake, Selenga, and Lena River deltas. When solely using remotely sensed variables, the generalized framework is especially suitable for modeling applications in large-scale delta systems, where data and field accessibility are limited.},

  abstract = {Disparity between watershed erosion rates and downstream sediment delivery has remained an important theme in geomorphology for many decades, with the role of floodplains in sediment storage as a common focus. In the Piedmont Province of the eastern USA, upland deforestation and agricultural land use following European settlement led to accumulation of thick packages of overbank sediment in valley bottoms, commonly referred to as legacy deposits. Previous authors have argued that legacy deposits represent a potentially important source of modern sediment loads following remobilization by lateral migration and progressive channel widening. This paper seeks to quantify (1) rates of sediment remobilization from Baltimore County floodplains by channel migration and bank erosion, (2) proportions of streambank sediment derived from legacy deposits, and (3) potential contribution of net streambank erosion and legacy sediments to downstream sediment yield within the Mid-Atlantic Piedmont. We calculated measurable gross erosion and deposition rates within the fluvial corridor along 40 valley segments from 18 watersheds with drainage areas between 0.18 and 155km2in Baltimore County, Maryland. We compared stream channel and floodplain morphology from lidar-based digital elevation data collected in 2005 with channel positions recorded on 1:2400 scale topographic maps from 1959-1961 in order to quantify 44-46years of channel change. Sediment bulk density and particle size distributions were characterized from streambank and channel deposit samples and used for volume to mass conversions and for comparison with other sediment sources. Average annual lateral migration rates ranged from 0.04 to 0.19m/y, which represented an annual migration of 2.5\% (0.9-4.4\%) channel width across all study segments, suggesting that channel dimensions may be used as reasonable predictors of bank erosion rates. Gross bank erosion rates varied from 43 to 310Mg/km/y (median=114) and were positively correlated with drainage area. Measured deposition within channels accounted for an average of 46\% (28-75\%) of gross erosion, with deposition increasingly important in larger drainages. Legacy sediments accounted for 6-90\% of bank erosion at individual study segments, represented about 60\% of bank height at most exposures, and accounted for 57\% ({$\pm$}16\%) of the measured gross erosion. Extrapolated results indicated that first- and second-order streams accounted for 62\% ({$\pm$}38\%) of total streambank erosion from 1005km2of northern Baltimore County. After accounting for estimated redeposition, extrapolated net streambank sediment yields (72Mg/km2/y) constituted 70\% of estimated average Piedmont watershed yields (104Mg/km2/y). The results suggest that streambank sediments are a relatively large source of sediment from Piedmont tributaries to the Chesapeake Bay.},

  abstract = {Increased availability and resolution of remotely-sensed (RS) imagery of Earth's surface has greatly enhanced the precision, spatial extent, and temporal frequency at which we can analyze river channel migration and width changes. Despite a body of research identifying and quantifying sources of uncertainty inherent in such data, no framework has emerged to comprehensively quantify and handle uncertainty. Herein, we summarize and evaluate present best practices, test new approaches to quantify and handle uncertainty, and provide recommendations for future work using remotely-sensed measurements of river migration and width changes. While our research focuses on river systems, the principles and approaches are applicable to research delineating boundaries or using boundaries to measure changes: glacier retreat or advance, erosion or deposition along coastlines and lakeshores, changes in wetland extent, expansion or contraction of vegetation (e.g., deforestation), cliff retreat, sea level rise due to climate change, change in aeolian depositional systems, and anthropogenic/political boundary disputes. From our results, the following conclusions and recommendations arise:1.Planform change measurements should span spatial intervals larger than coherent units of adjustment to avoid spatial autocorrelation.2.Uncertainty in manual riverbank delineations is dominated by arbitrary user inconsistency rather than poor image quality (i.e., resolution, colour versus grayscale, year of acquisition) or environmental conditions (i.e., shadows and vegetation cover).3.We recommend that digitizations follow the vegetated boundary that best approximates bankfull width, whenever possible, to avoid inconsistency along ambiguous reaches.4.Using a spatially variable level of error detection (LoD) threshold improves the quantity and quality of retained measurements relative to a uniform LoD.5.After applying a LoD threshold, we recommend first using expert discretion to manually classify any `nondetect' measurements that qualify as `significant' measurements of zero (i.e., no change actually occurred).6.Subsequently, three methods may be used for handling the remaining nondetects; Kaplan-Meier (KM) and Maximum Likelihood Estimators (MLE). The specific approach chosen for handling nondetects is contingent upon each case, but can be guided and informed by descriptions and assumptions of each method, references to external resources, and results of our river-focused analyses.7.Finally, we encourage a focus on improving the simplicity, generalizability, and open-source opportunities of tools and packages used for calculating river planform change and spatially variable uncertainty, thereby enabling a common platform to measure and compare results.},

Annual export of suspended sediment and carbonate upstream from the Yukon Delta averaged 68 Mt a,\`a\'i1 and 387 Gg a,\`a\'i1, respectively, with 50\% of the suspended sediment load originating in the Tanana River Basin and 88\% of the carbonate load originating in the White River Basin. About half the annual suspended sediment export occurred during spring, and half occurred during summer-autumn, with very little export in winter. On average, a minimum of 11 Mt a,\`a\'i1 of suspended sediment is deposited in floodplains between Eagle, Alaska, and Pilot Station, Alaska, on an annual basis, mostly in the Yukon Flats. There is about a 27\% loss in the carbonate load between Eagle and Yukon River near Stevens Village, with an additional loss of about 29\% between Stevens Village and Pilot Station, owing to a combination of deposition and dissolution. Comparison of current and historical suspended sediment loads for Tanana River suggests a possible link between suspended sediment yield and the Pacific decadal oscillation.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, the development of high-resolution flood hazard models have become feasible at continental and global scale, and their application in developing countries and data-scarce regions can be extremely helpful to increase preparedness of population and reduce catastrophic impacts. The present work describes the development of a novel procedure for global flood hazard mapping, based on the most recent advances in large scale flood modelling. We derive a long-term dataset of daily river discharges from the hydrological simulations of the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS). Streamflow data is downscaled on a high resolution river network and processed to provide the input for local flood inundation simulations, performed with a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model. All flood-prone areas identified along the river network are then merged to create continental flood hazard maps for different return periods at 30{${'}{'}$} resolution. We evaluate the performance of our methodology in several river basins across the globe by comparing simulated flood maps with both official hazard maps and a mosaic of flooded areas detected from satellite images. The evaluation procedure also includes comparisons with the results of other large scale flood models. We further investigate the sensitivity of the flood modelling framework to several parameters and modelling approaches and identify strengths, limitations and possible improvements of the methodology.},

The aim of this study was to perform a reconstruction of the lateral migration of a 15 km length of an active meandering river during the period 1930\textendash 2016. River morphological changes were analyzed and quantified from cadastral maps and aerial photographs as well as by geodetic survey and GIS. Hydrological characteristics and extreme hydrological events were evaluated in relation to bank erosion rate. The rate of bank erosion was markedly different from the long-term studied meanders, just like in the short-term period. During the 87 years of observation (from 1930 to 2016), the length of the Kolubara River was enlarged by 3.44 km. The average migration rate of the Kolubara River for monitored meanders in the period 1930\textendash 2010 was 1.9 m{$\cdot$}year -1 , while in the period 2010\textendash 2016, the average migration rate was 3.3 m{$\cdot$}year -1 . The rate of bank erosion was more intensive across the entire short-term period than during the longer period, and the maximum annual rate of bank erosion during the period 2010\textendash 2016 varied between 0.3 and 11.5 m. It is very likely that in the period from 2010, frequent discharge variations and rapid change of its extreme values caused more intensive bank erosion. These research results will be valuable for river channel management, engineering (soft and hard engineering), and planning purposes (predicting changes in river channel form) in the Kolubara River Basin.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Floods are the most common hazard to cause disasters and have led to extensive morbidity and mortality throughout the world. The impact of floods on the human community is related directly to the location and topography of the area, as well as human demographics and characteristics of the built environment. Objectives: The aim of this study is to identify the health impacts of disasters and the underlying causes of health impacts associated with floods. A conceptual framework is developed that may assist with the development of a rational and comprehensive approach to prevention, mitigation, and management. Methods: This study involved an extensive literature review that located {$>$}500 references, which were analyzed to identify common themes, findings, and expert views. The findings then were distilled into common themes. Results: The health impacts of floods are wide ranging, and depend on a number of factors. However, the health impacts of a particular flood are specific to the particular context. The immediate health impacts of floods include drowning, injuries, hypothermia, and animal bites. Health risks also are associated with the evacuation of patients, loss of health workers, and loss of health infrastructure including essential drugs and supplies. In the mediumterm, infected wounds, complications of injury, poisoning, poor mental health, communicable diseases, and starvation are indirect effects of flooding. In the long-term, chronic disease, disability, poor mental health, and poverty-related diseases including malnutrition are the potential legacy. Conclusions: This article proposes a structured approach to the classification of the health impacts of floods and a conceptual framework that demonstrates the relationships between floods and the direct and indirect health consequences.},

The most obvious of which is an Arctic Ocean largely covered by an ice sheet in summer versus one largely devoid of such cover. Ecosystems under pressure typically shift between such alternative states in an abrupt, rather than smooth manner, with the level of forcing required for shifting this status termed threshold or tipping point. Loss of Arctic ice due to anthropogenic climate change is accelerating, with the extent of Arctic sea ice displaying increased variance at present, a leading indicator of the proximity of a possible tipping point. Reduced ice extent is expected, in turn, to trigger a number of additional tipping elements, physical, chemical, and biological, in motion, with potentially large impacts on the Arctic marine ecosystem.},

If, as usual, surface buoyancy fluxes are placed entirely in the topmost model level, our model produces excessive convective mixing in the Southern Ocean. This results in poor stimulated salinity in the Southern Ocean. In this simulation, we assume, as usual, that both surface buoyancy forcing and vertical mixing are homogeneous within each grid cell. If, on the other hand, destabilizing surface fluxes are instantaneously mixed into the subsurface ocean, the model produces much less convective mixing and much more realistic salinities. The vertical mixing of surface buoyancy fluxes performed in this simulation is equivalent to assuming that those fluxes affect only a small fraction of each grid cell, and cause vertical mixing only in that limited area. Our interpretation of these results is that the usual assumption that both surface buoyancy forcing and vertical mixing are uniform within each grid cell has a detrimental effect on model results; these results could be significantly improved by good parametrizations which treat the horizontal inhomogeneity of surface buoyancy forcing and of vertical mixing.},

For one of the catchments in this area, the Schrondweilerbaach catchemtn, a sediment budget was constructed in order to determine the relative contributions of the various channel and valley slope processes to sediment output. Streambanks contributed 53 per cent of the output with bank scour and subsoil fall being the main processes while to a lesser extent bank material was supplied by bank failures, splash erosion, and soil creep. The remaining 47 per cent of the sediment was derived from the valley slopes mainly through the combined action of rainsplash detachment and overland flow transport. During the two years of investigations sediment output from the drainage basin almost equalled sediment input from streambanks and valley slopes. The results of the measurements of the various streambank processes are integrated in a descriptive model for the present-day widening of valley incisions in the study area and used to hypothesize the palaeohydrological development of the basin. Special attention is paid to the (in)direct effects of the forest vegetation on streambank erosion and sediment transport through the stream channel.},

  abstract = {Densely populated river deltas are losing land at an alarming rate and to successfully restore these environments we must understand the details of their morphology. Toward this end we present a set of five metrics that describe delta morphology: (1) the fractal dimension, (2) the distribution of island sizes, (3) the nearest-edge distance, (4) a synthetic distribution of sediment fluxes at the shoreline, and (5) the nourishment area. The nearest-edge distance is the shortest distance to channelized or unchannelized water from a given location on the delta and is analogous to the inverse of drainage density in tributary networks. The nourishment area is the downstream delta area supplied by the sediment coming through a given channel cross section and is analogous to catchment area in tributary networks. As a first step, we apply these metrics to four relatively simple, fluvially dominated delta networks. For all these deltas, the average nearest-edge distances are remarkably constant moving down delta suggesting that the network organizes itself to maintain a consistent distance to the nearest channel. Nourishment area distributions can be predicted from a river mouth bar model of delta growth, and also scale with the width of the channel and with the length of the longest channel, analogous to Hack's law for drainage basins. The four delta channel networks are fractal, but power laws and scale invariance appear to be less pervasive than in tributary networks. Thus, deltas may occupy an advantageous middle ground between complete similarity and complete dissimilarity, where morphologic differences indicate different behavior.},

  abstract = {Geochemical environments, fates, and effects are modeled for methane released into seawater by the decomposition of climate-sensitive clathrates. A contemporary global background cycle is first constructed, within the framework of the Parallel Ocean Program. Input from organics in the upper thermocline is related to oxygen levels, and microbial consumption is parameterized from available rate measurements. Seepage into bottom layers is then superimposed, representing typical seabed fluid flow. The resulting CH4 distribution is validated against surface saturation ratios, vertical sections, and slope plume studies. Injections of clathrate-derived methane are explored by distributing a small number of point sources around the Arctic continental shelf, where stocks are extensive and susceptible to instability during the first few decades of global warming. Isolated bottom cells are assigned dissolved gas fluxes from porous-media simulation. Given the present bulk removal pattern, methane does not penetrate far from emission sites. Accumulated effects, however, spread to the regional scale following the modeled current system. Both hypoxification and acidification are documented. Sensitivity studies illustrate a potential for material restrictions to broaden the perturbations, since methanotrophic consumers require nutrients and trace metals. When such factors are considered, methane buildup within the Arctic basin is enhanced. However, freshened polar surface waters act as a barrier to atmospheric transfer, diverting products into the deep return flow. Uncertainties in the logic and calculations are enumerated including those inherent in high-latitude clathrate abundance, buoyant effluent rise through the column, representation of the general circulation, and bacterial growth kinetics.},

We examined whether basic principles of graph theory can be extended to other ecosystems. Specifically, we demonstrate how a network-based context can be used for enhancing the more effective conservation of riverine systems. We first show how to use graph theoretic techniques to model riverscapes at the segment level. Then we use a real stream network (Zagyva river basin, Hungary) to examine the topological importance of segments in maintaining riverscape connectivity, using betweenness centrality, a commonly used network measure. Using the undirected graph model of this riverscape, we then prioritize segments for conservation purpose. We examine the value of each of the 93 segments present in the Zagyva river basin by considering the conservation value of local fish assemblages, connectivity and the size of the habitat patches. For this purpose we use the `integral index of connectivity', a recently advocated habitat availability index. Based on the results the selection of the most valuable habitat segments can be optimized depending on conservation resources. Because of their inherent advantage in the consideration of connectivity relationships, we suggest that network analyses offer a simple, yet effective tool for searching for key segments (or junctions) in riverscapes for conservation and environmental management. Further, although the joint consideration of aquatic and terrestrial networks is challenging, the extension of network analyses to freshwater systems may facilitate the more effective selection of priority areas for conservation in continental areas.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} By coordinating the design and distribution of global climate model simulations of the past, current, and future climate, the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) has become one of the foundational elements of climate science. However, the need to address an ever-expanding range of scientific questions arising from more and more research communities has made it necessary to revise the organization of CMIP. After a long and wide community consultation, a new and more federated structure has been put in place. It consists of three major elements: (1) a handful of common experiments, the DECK (Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima) and CMIP historical simulations (1850\textendash near present) that will maintain continuity and help document basic characteristics of models across different phases of CMIP; (2) common standards, coordination, infrastructure, and documentation that will facilitate the distribution of model outputs and the characterization of the model ensemble; and (3) an ensemble of CMIP-Endorsed Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs) that will be specific to a particular phase of CMIP (now CMIP6) and that will build on the DECK and CMIP historical simulations to address a large range of specific questions and fill the scientific gaps of the previous CMIP phases. The DECK and CMIP historical simulations, together with the use of CMIP data standards, will be the entry cards for models participating in CMIP. Participation in CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs by individual modelling groups will be at their own discretion and will depend on their scientific interests and priorities. With the Grand Science Challenges of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) as its scientific backdrop, CMIP6 will address three broad questions: {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} \&ndash; How does the Earth system respond to forcing?{$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} \&ndash; What are the origins and consequences of systematic model biases? {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} \&ndash; How can we assess future climate changes given internal climate variability, predictability, and uncertainties in scenarios?{$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} This CMIP6 overview paper presents the background and rationale for the new structure of CMIP, provides a detailed description of the DECK and CMIP6 historical simulations, and includes a brief introduction to the 21 CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs.{$<$}/p{$><$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Salt marsh tidal channels are highly sinuous. For this project, field surveys and aerial photographs were used to characterize the planform of tidal channels at China Camp Marsh in the San Francisco Bay, California. To model the planform evolution, we assume that the topographic curvature of the channel centreline is a key element driving meander migration. Extraction of curvature data from a planimetric survey, however, presents certain problems because simple calculations based on equally distanced points on the channel axis produce numerical noise that pollutes the final curvature data. We found that a spline interpolation and a polynomial fit to the survey data provided us with a robust means of calculating channel curvature. The curvature calculations, combined with data from numerous cross-sections along the tidal channel, were used to parameterize a computer model. With this model, based on recent theoretical work, the relationship between planform shape and meander migration as well as the consequences of bidirectional flow on planform evolution have been investigated. Bank failure in vegetated salt marsh channels is characterized by slump blocks that persist in the channel for several years. It is therefore possible to identify reaches of active bank erosion and test model predictions. Our results suggest that the geometry and evolution of meanders at China Camp Marsh, California, reflect the ebb-dominated regime. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2004 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Summary Isotope tracers are widely used to study hydrological processes in small catchments, but their use in continental-scale hydrological modeling has been limited. This paper describes the development of an isotope-enabled global water balance and transport model (iWBM/WTM) capable of simulating key hydrological processes and associated isotopic responses at the large scale. Simulations and comparisons of isotopic signals in precipitation and river discharge from available datasets, particularly the IAEA GNIP global precipitation climatology and the USGS river isotope dataset spanning the contiguous United States, as well as selected predictions of isotopic response in yet unmonitored areas illustrate the potential for isotopes to be applied as a diagnostic tool in water cycle model development. Various realistic and synthetic forcings of the global hydrologic and isotopic signals are discussed. The test runs demonstrate that the primary control on isotope composition of river discharge is the isotope composition of precipitation, with land surface characteristics and precipitation-amount having less impact. Despite limited availability of river isotope data at present, the application of realistic climatic and isotopic inputs in the model also provides a better understanding of the global distribution of isotopic variations in evapotranspiration and runoff, and reveals a plausible approach for constraining the partitioning of surface and subsurface runoff and the size and variability of the effective groundwater pool at the macro-scale.},

This contains more than 2500 samples from 60 sites that have been running since the 1970s and are still operated on an almost quarterly basis. These data provide a valuable basis for assessing suspended sediment yields in the largest river basin on earth. We also discuss the sampling procedures and the methods for total suspended sediment (TSS) flux calculation employed in the Amazon region. An analysis of the contribution of the largest Amazon River tributaries to the total sediment load of the Amazon and the relationship between TSS and water discharge has been undertaken. The Brazilian data provide representative information on sediment transport within the basin, particularly for the central flood plain and in the Brazilian and Guiana shields. A basic assessment of the suspended sediment load data highlights the major Andean TSS contribution (more than 1000 106 t year-1) and the lower contribution from the shield areas (less than 100 106 t year-1). On the basis of the data from the network of TSS stations, the shield areas are estimated to contribute 7\% of the TSS yield from the Amazon River basin. A region of deposition has been identified in the middle of the basin; and the sedimentation rate in the lsquov\'arzeasrsquo in the Amazon River basin lowlands has been estimated to be between 3 and 6 mm year-1.

Here, we demonstrate that for extremes stakeholders will have to deal with large irreducible uncertainties on local to regional scales as a result of internal variability, even if climate models improve rapidly. A multimember initial condition ensemble carried out with an Earth system model shows that trends towards more intense hot and less intense cold extremes may be masked or even reversed locally for the coming three to five decades even if greenhouse gas emissions rapidly increase. Likewise, despite a long-term trend towards more intense precipitation and longer dry spells, multidecadal trends of opposite sign cannot be excluded over many land points. However, extremes may dramatically change at a rate much larger than anticipated from the long-term signal. Despite these large irreducible uncertainties on the local scale, projections are remarkably consistent from an aggregated spatial probability perspective. Models agree that within only three decades about half of the land fraction will see significantly more intense hot extremes. We show that even in the short term the land fraction experiencing more intense precipitation events is larger than expected from internal variability. The proposed perspective yields valuable information for decision-makers and stakeholders at the international level.},

This evidence also conclusively proves that the Mississippi Valley alluvium is of Recent age and fills a deeply entrenched valley system eroded during the late Wisconsin glacial stage. Both the Recent age and the mineralogy of the alluvium make it an impossible source for the several loess "formations" as described in the region by M. M. Leighton and H. B. Willman. Furthermore, the age of their loess "formations" does not conform with the age of the Pleistocene terrace deposits which the loess mantles. The distribution of lower-valley loess, its topographic expression, the absence of associated sand dunes and fossil trees, and the presence of colluvial features make it difficult to accept the hypothesis of eolian origin for loess in this region. The loessification theory held by R. J. Russell is the only hypothesis yet pro- posed that is in accord with known facts.},

Anopheles species had the largest predicted species ranges, whereas species of Deinocerites and Wyeomyia had the smallest. 5. Species richness was estimated for 1\textdegree{} grids and by summing predicted presence of species from ENM.

Bank erosion was measured over a short period using a network of erosion pins along a small stream (1400 m long) to quantify the material exported during a single winter (2012\textendash 2013). The material exported by this same stream over the last 69 years was quantified using an original approach involving the comparison of a compilation of three-dimensional historical stream redesign plans that date back to 1944 with the state of the banks in 2013 (differential global positioning system and LiDAR data). The results suggest that a global trend of material loss along the stream banks monitored by erosion pins, with an average erosion rate of 17.7 mm year-1 and an average volume of exported material of 75 t km-1. Over 69 years, this same stream exported an average of 36 t km-1 year-1, and the average loss of material from the banks throughout the whole catchment was estimated to be 14 t km-1 year-1. The contribution of bank material to the filling of the pond over the last 10 years is between 46\% and 52\% based on an extrapolation of erosion pin dynamics or between 27\% and 30\% based on the comparison of LiDAR data to the average historical profile extrapolated for the catchment. These results suggest that bank erosion represents a major source of sediment in degraded waters in traditionally understudied agricultural lowland catchments, where anthropogenic pressures are high.},

Here, the technicalities of implementing the parameterization in the coarse-resolution ocean component of global climate models are made explicit, and the primary impacts on model solutions of implementing the parameterization are discussed. Three global ocean general circulation models including this parameterization are contrasted with control simulations lacking the parameterization. The MLE parameterization behaves as expected and fairly consistently in models differing in discretization, boundary layer mixing, resolution, and other parameterizations. The primary impact of the parameterization is a shoaling of the mixed layer, with the largest effect in polar winter regions. Secondary impacts include strengthening the Atlantic meridional overturning while reducing its variability, reducing CFC and tracer ventilation, modest changes to sea surface temperature and air\textendash sea fluxes, and an apparent reduction of sea ice basal melting.},

We analyzed the distributions of these properties, identified their typical ranges, and explored relationships between river planform and slope. We found width to be directly associated with the magnitude of meander wavelength and catchment area. Moreover, we found that narrower rivers show a larger range of slope and sinuosity values than wider rivers. Finally, by comparing simulated discharge from a water balance model with measured widths, we show that power laws between mean annual discharge and width can predict width typically to -35\% to +81\%, even when a single relationship is applied across all rivers with discharge ranging from 100 to 50,000 m3/s.},

  abstract = {A catastrophic flood in 1965 on Plum Creek, a perennial sandbed stream in the western Great Plains, removed most of the bottomland vegetation and transformed the single-thalweg stream into a wider, braided channel. Following eight years of further widening associated with minor high flows, a process of channel narrowing began in 1973; narrowing continues today. The history of channel narrowing was reconstructed by counting the annual rings of 129 trees and shrubs along a 5-km reach of Plum Creek near Louviers, Colorado. Sixty-three of these plants were excavated in order to determine the age and elevation of the germination point. The reconstructed record of channel change was verified from historical aerial photographs, and then compared to sediment stratigraphy and records of discharge and bed elevation from a streamflow gaging station in the study reach. Channel narrowing at Plum Creek occurs in two ways. First, during periods of high flow, sand and fine gravel are delivered to the channel, temporarily raising the general bed-level. Subsequently, several years of uninterrupted low flows incise a narrower channel. Second, during years of low flow, vegetation becomes established on the subaerial part of the present channel bed. In both cases, surfaces stabilize as a result of vegetation growth and vertical accretion of sediment.},

Discharge in a river channel grows as drainage basin area increases following the general equation Q = kA\textbackslash textlesssup\textbackslash textgreaterc\textbackslash textless/sup\textbackslash textgreater, where Q is river discharge, k is a measure of river base flow, A is upstream drainage area, and c is the scaling power dependency. Land use is a critical variable in the examination of river discharge; discharge has significant geologic and ecologic influences on fluvial systems. Discharge is assumed to scale linearly or nearly linearly with drainage area (c {$\sim$}1), but in spite of its widespread application, the relationship has not been explicitly tested with respect to urbanization. Here we show that in small urban settings the scaling is nonlinear for peak flows. It is proposed that effective water loading occurs through a combination of increased runoff and an increase in the rate of transport to the rivers. These higher discharges in urban rivers have the potential to increase erosion, degrade aquatic habitats, and significantly alter channel forms.

  abstract = {Discharge is the independent variable primarily responsible for shaping the hydraulic geometry and longitudinal profile of rivers. The assumption is frequently made that discharge and drainage area scale linearly or nearly linearly, i.e., Q = kAc, where k is the theoretical discharge for a unit area watershed (A = 1), Q is river discharge (m3/s), A is drainage area (m2), and c is the scaling power dependency. Watershed and longitudinal profile modeling enjoy simplified assumptions if discharge grows linearly with drainage area, and this assumption is widely applied. This paper investigates the scaling relationship between discharge and drainage area for five large rivers, with an emphasis on exploring the linearity of the discharge-area relationship and suggesting causes for significant departure from linearity. The five large mainstem rivers explored (John Day, Salmon, Wabash, Greenbrier, and Yellowstone) all have a minimum of 60 years of continuous discharge records and have been selected to represent a wide geographic area spanning different land uses, climate, and topography. Peak annual flow and mean annual flow are compiled from the U.S. Geological Survey national surface-water database, and a linear regression analysis was completed for each year for the discharges. The five rivers were selected to minimize, but not eliminate, the impacts of dams and diversions such as for irrigation on river discharges. The scaling factor (c) exhibits both secular and nonsecular trends over the length of record for these five rivers. The results show that the studied watersheds can be grouped into two broad categories based on their respective c values: (1) those rivers where c is 1 or nearly 1, and (2) those rivers where c is significantly \textbackslash textless1. The John Day, Salmon, Wabash, and Greenbrier rivers scale at values of {$\sim$}0.8 with natural variables including slope, elevation, and evapotranspiration potentially accounting for c values slightly \textbackslash textless1. The second category is c values of {$\sim$}0.5, as exhibited by the Yellowstone River. The Yellowstone watershed is unique for our study because of its secular trend, as well as its overall lower average c values. Climatic trends that control the timing of winter snowpack melting, increased frequency and intensity of forest fires, and increased human consumptive water use in downstream areas may all contribute to the observed behavior in c for this watershed. The results from this set of rivers have broad implications for studies ranging from the modeling of fluvial erosion in numeric landscape evolution models to allocations of water resources for human and environmental purposes. \textcopyright{} 2007 Geological Society of America.},

Landscape attributes that vary with microtopography, such as active layer thickness (ALT), are labor intensive and difficult to document effectively through in situ methods at kilometer spatial extents, thus rendering remotely sensed methods desirable. Spatially explicit estimates of ALT can provide critically needed data for parameterization, initialization, and evaluation of Arctic terrestrial models. In this work, we demonstrate a new approach using high-resolution remotely sensed data for estimating centimeter-scale ALT in a 5 km 2 area of ice-wedge polygon terrain in Barrow, Alaska. We use a simple regression-based, machine learning data-fusion algorithm that uses topographic and spectral metrics derived from multisensor data (LiDAR and WorldView-2) to estimate ALT (2 m spatial resolution) across the study area. Comparison of the ALT estimates with ground-based measurements, indicates the accuracy (r 2 =0.76, RMSE {$\pm$}4.4 cm) of the approach. While it is generally accepted that broad climatic variability associated with increasing air temperature will govern the regional averages of ALT, consistent with prior studies, our findings using highresolution LiDAR and WorldView-2 data, show that smaller-scale variability in ALT is controlled by local ecohydro- geomorphic factors. This work demonstrates a path forward for mapping ALT at high spatial resolution and across sufficiently large regions for improved understanding and predictions of coupled dynamics among permafrost, hydrology, and land-surface processes from readily available remote sensing data.},

While many of the problems are long-standing, various studies indicate that coastal villages are becoming more susceptible to flooding and erosion due in part to rising temperatures. The Corps of Engineers and the Natural Resources Conservation Service administer key programs for constructing flooding and erosion control projects. However, small and remote Alaska Native villages often fail to qualify for assistance under these programs\textemdash largely because of agency requirements that the expected costs of the project not exceed its benefits. Even villages that do meet the cost/benefit criteria may still not receive assistance if they cannot meet the cost-share requirement for the project. Of the nine villages we were directed to review, four\textemdash Kivalina, Koyukuk, Newtok, and Shishmaref\textemdash are in imminent danger from flooding and erosion and are planning to relocate, while the remaining five are in various stages of responding to these problems. Costs for relocating are expected to be high. For example, the cost estimates for relocating Kivalina range from \$100 million to over \$400 million. Relocation is a daunting process that may take several years to accomplish. During that process, federal agencies must make wise investment decisions, yet GAO found instances where federal agencies invested in infrastructure at the villages' existing sites without knowledge of their plans to relocate. GAO, federal and state officials, and village representatives identified some alternatives that could increase service delivery for Alaska Native villages, although many important factors must first be considered:},

Four products, three from Aquarius and one from SMOS, were evaluated and shown to be generally consistent within 0.3 to 0.6 psu and agree favorably with in situ measurements. However, although the Aquarius products show consistent seasonality of SSS with high values of 34.45 in October and low values of 33.40 in May, the SMOS and SMAP products lack such seasonal variations. This may be caused by larger uncertainties in the SMOS and SMAP data due in part to the lack of concurrent scatterometer measurements that is used to correct for roughness effects. The four products provide similar spatial distributions of SSS with root-mean-square-difference from 0.25 to 0.58 psu. Differences among Aquarius products are mainly due to varying salinity retrieval algorithms, smoothing, and masking of sea ice while the SMOS product showed the highest SSS deviation that is likely due to the bias-adjustment done on the dataset. Our analyses show that SSS in the Southern Ocean region has significant meridional variations with the lowest SSS near the ice edge and highest at lower latitudes. The SSS is also lowest in summer indicating the predominant influence of sea ice and glacial melt but it stays low near ice edges even during the growth season.},

  abstract = {Abstract: The relationship between channel bank erosion, monitored over a 14 month period, and a number of hydrometeorological parameters is examined. The influence of frost action, particularly through the formation of needle ice, was found to be the most significant factor determining erosion at one site and on the upper portion of the bank at the other two. On melting of the ice a readily erodible skin of material remains covering the bank face. Towards the middle and lower sections of the bank hydrological variables, particularly gauge height, become more important in controlling the removal of material. Measured erosion rates varied between and within sites, ranging from 7.6-13.86 cm per year, confined mainly to the winter season, especially December and January. During the summer the action of subaerial surface processes on the bank resulted in the formation of a thin covering of loose material, which was removed in early winter. Comparison with other available data showed erosion rates recorded in this study to be higher than previously reported for Northern Ireland, but well within the range for similar bank material measured elsewhere. In total 5.9 tonnes of material were eroded from the channel banks accounting for four per cent of the annual suspended sediment load of the river at the study site.},

  abstract = {Assessing hydromorphological and floristic patterns along a regulated Mediterranean river: The Serpis River (Spain) In the European context, several methodologies have been developed to assess the ecological status and, specifically, the hydromorphological status of running surface waters. Although these methodologies have been widely used, few studies have focused on hydrologically altered water bodies and the factors that may determine their status. In this study, the Serpis River was divided into 16 segments from the Beniarres dam (40 km from the river mouth) to the sea, all of which are affected by flow regulation, but with different severity. In each segment, an inventory of the flora was conducted, and hydromorphological indices (QBR, Riparian Habitat Quality Index; and IHF, River Habitat Index) were applied. The objectives of the study were (A) to identify relationships between floristic composition and QBR components and (B) between instream habitat characteristics and IHF components as well as (C) to determine the main factors controlling the floristic composition and riparian habitat quality (QBR) and the factors controlling instream habitat characteristics and heterogeneity (IHF). A cluster analysis allowed grouping sites according to their floristic composition and instream habitat characteristics, and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) was used to ordinate the sites, obtaining the biotic and instream habitat characteristics, as well as the QBR and IHF subindices, which better explained the spatial patterns. Finally, a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) with predictor variables (geographical, hydrological, geomorphological and human pressures) indicated the main factors controlling the spatial patterns of the floristic composition, instream habitat characteristics, riparian habitat quality and instream habitat heterogeneity. A gradient of riparian and instream habitat quality was identified. Our results suggest that physical constraints (presence of a gorge) have protected sites from severe human impacts, resulting in good ecological quality, despite hydrological alteration. This area, where there is geomorphological control, could be potentially reclassified into a different ecotype because regular monitoring could be using incorrect references for index scores, and naturally high scores could be confused with recovery from hydrological alteration or other pressures. The sites with the worst quality were near the river mouth and were characterised by an artificial and highly variable flow regime (related to large autumnal floods and frequent human-induced periods of zero flow). This artificial flow variability as well as the presence of lateral structures in the river channel and geomorphological characteristics were identified as the main factors driving the hydromorphological and floristic pattern in this regulated river.},

Efforts to measure ocean salinity from space are designed for large scale open ocean environments, not coastal regions. In the Mid-Atlantic coastal ocean, salinity is critical for understanding circulation patterns, river plumes, and transport, which in turn impact the status of the ecosystem.

  abstract = {A fundamental challenge in understanding the global nitrogen cycle is the quantification of denitrification on large heterogeneous landscapes. Because floodplains are important sites for denitrification and nitrogen retention, we developed a generalized floodplain biogeochemical model to determine whether dams and flood-control levees affect floodplain denitrification by altering floodplain inundation. We combined a statistical model of floodplain topography with a model of hydrology and nitrogen biogeochemistry to simulate floods of different magnitude. The model predicted substantial decreases in NO3-N processing on floodplains whose overbank floods have been altered by levees and upstream dams. Our simulations suggest that dams may reduce nitrate processing more than setback levees. Levees increased areal floodplain denitrification rates, but this effect was offset by a reduction in the area inundated. Scenarios that involved a levee also resulted in more variability in N processing among replicate floodplains. Nitrate loss occurred rapidly and completely in our model floodplains. As a consequence, total flood volume and the initial mass of nitrate reaching a floodplain may provide reasonable estimates of total N processing on floodplains during floods. This finding suggests that quantifying the impact of dams and levees on floodplain denitrification may be possible using recent advances in remote sensing of floodplain topography and flood stage. Furthermore, when considering flooding over the long-term, the cumulative N processed by frequent smaller floods was estimated to be quite large relative to that processed by larger, less frequent floods. Our results suggest that floodplain denitrification may be greatly influenced by the pervasive anthropogenic flood-control measures that currently exist on most majors river floodplains throughout the world, and may have the potential to be impacted by future changes in flood probabilities that will likely occur as a result of climate shifts.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a conceptual framework and methodology to assist with optimising the outcomes of river rehabilitation in terms of delivery of multiple ecosystem services and the benefits they represent for humans at the river network scale. The approach is applicable globally, but was initially devised in the context of a project critically examining opportunities and constraints on delivery of river rehabilitation in Scotland. The spatial-temporal approach highlighted is river rehabilitation measure, rehabilitation scale, location on the stream network, ecosystem service and timescale specific and could be used as initial scoping in the process of planning rehabilitation at the river network scale. The levels of service delivered are based on an expert-derived scoring system based on understanding how the rehabilitation measure assists in reinstating important geomorphological, hydrological and ecological processes and hence intermediate or primary ecosystem function. The framework permits a ``total long-term ({$>$}25 years) ecosystem service score'' to be calculated which is the cumulative result of the combined effect of the number of and level of ecosystem services delivered over time. Trajectories over time for attaining the long-term ecosystem service score for each river rehabilitation measures are also given. Scores could also be weighted according to societal values and economic valuation. These scores could assist decision making in relation to river rehabilitation at the catchment scale in terms of directing resources towards alternative scenarios. A case study is presented of applying the methodology to the Eddleston Water in Scotland using proposed river rehabilitation options for the catchment to demonstrate the value of the approach. Our overall assertion is that unless sound conceptual frameworks are developed that permit the river network scale ecosystem services of river rehabilitation to be evaluated as part of the process of river basin planning and management, the total benefit of river rehabilitation may well be reduced. River rehabilitation together with a `vision' and framework within which it can be developed, is fundamental to future success in river basin management.},

  abstract = {The assessment of response of an aged concrete dam is important for the prediction of its behavior during earthquakes, so that remedial measures can be taken at the right time to withstand future earthquakes. The assessment is necessary, since the analyses procedures may become obsolete and the state of the art may change as the time of construction and the structural material may deteriorate due to harsh environmental conditions. At the same time, the sediment will be accumulated at the reservoir bottom on the upstream side of the dam. The process of siltation depends on the reservoir topography and climatic variability, i.e., increased flood frequency and river inflow. The decision of retrofitting or strengthening the aged dam necessitates accurate analysis of the same in the presence of accumulated sediment. In this paper, an approach to include the time-dependent degradation of concrete owing to environmental factors and mechanical loading in terms of isotropic degradation index is presented. The absorption of pressure waves at the bottom of the reservoir due to the presence of sediments has been incorporated in the hydrodynamic pressure equation. The response of an aged concrete dam in the presence of sediment layers under seismic excitation is studied. The outcomes show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract = {Summary The accuracy of runoff routing for global water-balance models and land-surface schemes is limited by the low spatial resolution of flow networks. Many such networks have been developed for specific models at specific spatial resolutions. However, although low-resolution networks can be derived by up-scaling algorithms from high-resolution datasets, such low-resolution networks are inherently incoherent, and slight differences in their spatial resolution can cause significant deviations in routing dynamics. By neglecting convective delay, storage-based routing algorithms produce artificially early arriving peaks on large scales. A theoretical comparison between a diffusion-wave-routing algorithm and linear-reservoir-routing (LRR) algorithm on a 30-km cell demonstrated that the commonly used LRR method consistently underestimates the travel time through the cells. A new aggregated network-response-function (NRF) routing algorithm was proposed in this study and evaluated against a conventional flow-net-based cell-to-cell LRR algorithm. The evaluation was done for the 25,325km2 Dongjiang (East River) basin, a tributary to the Pearl River in southern China well equipped with hydrological and meteorological stations. The NRF method transfers high-resolution delay dynamics, instead of networks, to any lower spatial resolution where runoff is generated. It preserves, over all scales, the spatially distributed time-delay information in the 1-km HYDRO1k flow network in the form of simple cell-response functions for any low-resolution grid. The NRF routing was shown to be scale independent for latitude\textendash longitude resolutions ranging from 5{${'}$} to 1\textdegree. This scale independency allowed a study of input heterogeneity on modelled discharge modelled with a daily version of the WASMOD-M water-balance model. The model efficiency of WASMOD-M-generated daily discharge at the Boluo gauging station in the Dongjiang basin in south China was constantly high (0.89) within the whole range of resolutions when routed by the NRF algorithm. The performance dropped sharply for decreasing resolution when runoff was routed with the LRR method. The three WASMOD-M parameters were scale independent in combination with NRF, but not with LRR, and the same parameter values gave equally good results at all spatial resolutions. The effect of spatial resolution on the routing delay was much more important than the spatial variability of the climate-input field for scales ranging from 5{${'}$} to 1\textdegree. The extra information in a distributed versus a uniform climate input could only be used when the NRF method was used to route the runoff. NRF requires more labour than LRR to set up but the model performance is very much higher than the LRR's once this is done. The NRF method, therefore, provides a significant potential to improve global-scale discharge predictions.},

  abstract = {Coupling of global hydrologic and atmospheric models is difficult because of the highly nonlinear hydrological processes to be integrated at large scales. Aggregation of high-resolution data into low-resolution spatial distribution functions is one way to preserve information and account for the nonlinearity. We used HydroSHEDS, presently the most highly resolved (3{${''}$}) global hydrography available, to provide accurate control on global river routing through a computationally efficient algorithm. The high resolution of HydroSHEDS allowed discrimination of river-channel pixels, and time-delay distributions were calculated for all such pixels. The distributions were aggregated into network-response functions (NRFs) for each low-resolution cell using an algorithm originally developed for the 1-km-resolution HYDRO1k hydrography. The large size of HydroSHEDS required a modification in algorithm to maintain computational efficiency. The new algorithm was tested with a high-quality local and a more uncertain global weather dataset to identify whether improved routing would provide a gain when weather data quality was limiting. The routing was coupled to the WASMOD-M runoff-generation model to evaluate discharge from the Dongjiang River and the Willamette River basins. The HydroSHEDS-based routing, compared with the HYDRO1k-based routing, provided a small gain in model efficiency, for local and global weather data and for both test basins. The HydroSHEDS-based routing, contrary to the HYDRO1k-based routing, provided physically realistic wave velocities. The most stable runoff-generation parameter values were achieved when HydroSHEDS was used to derive the NRFs. Routing was computed in two steps: first, a preparatory calculation which was a one-time effort and second, the routing during each simulation. The computational efficiency was four to five orders of magnitude better for the simulation step than that for the preparatory step. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {The paper presents an overview of recent publications on the fluvial suspended sediment flux to the Arctic Ocean. The total suspended matter exported from the Russian territory is 102 \texttimes{} 106 t/year and from the Canadian Arctic is 125 \texttimes{} 106 t/year. The total suspended matter (TSM) flux to the Arctic (227 \texttimes{} 106 t/year) is very low, only about 1\% of the global flux. Mean concentrations of suspended matter and specific sediment discharge are approximately one order of magnitude lower than the global concentration. An analysis of the trends in the sediment loads based on records of up to 62 years in length shows decreases (Yenisey), increases (Kolyma) and stability (Ob). Among the reasons for the very low concentrations and fluxes of suspended sediment in the Arctic rivers are thin weathering crusts on the Arctic watersheds, low precipitation, extensive permafrost, low temperatures for most of the year, large areas of swamps and lakes and a low level of human activity. A stochastic sediment transport model by Morehead et al. [Morehead, M.D., Syvitski, J.P., Hutton, E.W., Peckham, S.D., 2003. Modeling the temporal variability in the flux of sediment from ungauged river basins. Glob. Planet. Change 39, 95-110] is applied to the Arctic rivers to estimate the sediment load increase should the surface temperature of the drainage basin increase. For every 2 \textdegree C of warming a 30\% increase in the sediment flux could result and for each 20\% increase in water discharge, a 10\% increase in sediment load could follow. Based on this model, an increase of the sediment flux of six largest arctic rivers (Yenisey, Lena, Ob, Pechora, Kolyma and Severnaya Dvina) is predicted to range from 30\% to 122\% by 2100. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {The sequential changes in the position of banklines as a result of bank erosion, as well as various changes in the channel have been studied in the Subansiri river in Assam, India. The study was carried out from available topographic maps of 1920, 1970 and satellite imagery of 1990. The types of changes taking place in the Subansiri river channel as observed from the above-mentioned maps and imagery are grouped into four categories: (1) alteration of the direction of flow due to neck cut-off, (2) widening of a channel in response to bar development, (3) development (and subsequent abandonment) of anabranches, and (4) progressive shifting of meander bends. The river channel has become substantially wider during the period of 1970-1990. There has also been a progressive increase in the number and area of mid-channel bars with a corresponding decrease in the number and area of point bars during 1920-1990. These periodic and progressive changes are responsible for a change in channel pattern of the river. A study made on nature and amount of change in the banklines of the Subansiri river by dividing the channel (84 km in 1970) into 10 equal segments reveals that the types of change are varied, and in some cases chaotic in nature. Study of the bankline shift of the Subansiri determined separately for the periods 1920-1970, 1970-1990 and 1920-1990 at 20 evenly spaced transverse sections reveals that there has been a substantial westward shift of both the banklines, up to a maximum of 6 km, in the three upstream sections during 1920-1970. However, shifting of banklines in both directions and the unequal amount of shifting in the same direction have caused a marked increase in channel width during 1970-1990. It is found that due to bankline migration, the total amount of area eroded along the entire course under study during 1920-1970 and 1970-1990 are 107.90 and 57.50 km2, respectively. The overall sinuosity which was 1.51 in 1920 has decreased to 1.30 in 1970, while the corresponding braiding intensity has increased from 0.79 to 1.32. The river channel seems to make a remarkable change from a meandering pattern in 1920 towards a braided pattern by 1990 as seen from gradual increase in overall braiding intensity.},

The 112-year record of channel con-ditions along a portion of the Gila River provides data for the construction of 1ocational probability maps for main flow channels. Zones of stability and hazardous instability alternate with each other at 3.2 km (2 mi) intervals. During the past century the overall sinuosity of the main flow channel has remained close to 1.18, despite numerous changes in actual location. Spatial and temporal variation of sinuosity have occurred in subreaches as a result of sedimentation behind a dam and fluctuations in the density of phreatophyte growth, which both affect the hydraulics of flood flows. Unstable zones of the channel cor-respond to the surface of the sediment wedge behind the dam and areas dense phreatophyte growth. Stable zones correspond to areas controlled by bedrock or man-made structures, as well as locations de-termined by these external factors plus the requirement to maintain a consistent sinuosity. Channels such as that of the Gila River do not meet most assumptions of equilibrium and are best understood through probabilistic approaches with an assumption of catastrophic adjustment.},

Maps showing locational probabilities indicate that along the channel zones of relative locational stability alternate with zones of relative instability at a 3.2 km (2 mi) interval. Construction of upstream reservoirs has reduced sediment input into the main river but has not controlled floods. The channel width has not changed except for moderate fluctuations around mean values; the main-flow channel has incised approximately 6 m (20 ft) over most of the 48 km (30 mi) study reach during six recent floods. Gradient has remained unchanged. During floods bed material was mobilized to a depth below the original bed level that was greater than the height of the water surface above the original bed. Calculations based on tractive force indicate a threshold discharge of instability that is equal to the flow with a five-year return interval. The river exhibits remarkable stability with respect to gradient and sinuosity, irrespective of water and sediment discharges, but horizontal channel location exhibited selective instability. Over the record period of more than a century, the channel appears not to have been in equilibrium considering geometry, discharge, and sediment.},

Recent syntheses outline potential applications of network theory to ecological systems, but do not address the implications of physical structure for network dynamics. There is a specific need to examine how dendritic habitat structure, such as that found in stream, hedgerow and cave networks, influences ecological processes. Although dendritic networks are one type of ecological network, they are distinguished by two fundamental characteristics: (1) both the branches and the nodes serve as habitat, and (2) the specific spatial arrangement and hierarchical organization of these elements interacts with a species' movement behaviour to alter patterns of population distribution and abundance, and community interactions. Here, we summarize existing theory relating to ecological dynamics in dendritic networks, review empirical studies examining the population- and community-level consequences of these networks, and suggest future research integrating spatial pattern and processes in dendritic systems.},

Coupling between water column primary production and the benthos was investigated in summers 1984 to 1986 by measurements of sediment characteristics in relation to those of the water column. Low surface sediment C/N ratios (5.8 to 7.6) suggested a higher quality, nitrogen-rich marine carbon supply to the benthos in the highly productive (ca 250 to 300 g C m-' yr-') Bering Shelf-Anadyr Water (BSAW) compared to lower quality, higher C/N ratios (7 7 to 14 0) in sediment under the less productive (ca 50 g C m-' yr-l) Alaska Coastal Water (ACW).Stable carbon isotope ratios suggested a m a n n e origin for organic matter in BSAW compared to a mixture of m a n n e and terrestrial input in ACW. Mean benthic biomass was significantly different between water locations, with mean benthic biomass decreasing from 20.2 g C m-* under BSAW to 6.3 g C m-2 under ACW Summer benthic biomass remained seasonally constant for the 3 yr. Benthic communities underlying BSAW received a high quality marine food supply on a regular basis interannually, while those in ACW received an interannually variable amount of temgenous organic matter in addition to marine organic matter. We conclude that the quality and quantity of organic carbon deposited to the benthos directly influence benthic biomass.},

Mean benthic aerobic respiration rates significantly varied interannually in BSAW, although they were consistently 2 to 3 times greater in BSAW than in ACW within any one year, indicating that interannual variability in water column primary production may have a direct influence on the availability of organic carbon to the benthos. The explanation for higher respiration rates in the benthos beneath BSAW negates an expected reduction due to colder temperatures. A reduction in organic matter to the benthos in ACW apparently limits benthic metabolism even at higher temperatures. Macrofaunal respiration and bioturbation in high benthic biomass regions were important components in benthic carbon cycling.},

  abstract = {The shallow continental shelves and slope of the Amerasian Arctic are strongly influenced by nutrient-rich Pacific waters advected over the shelves from the northern Bering Sea into the Arctic Ocean. These high-latitude shelf systems are highly productive both as the ice melts and during the open-water period. The duration and extent of seasonal sea ice, seawater temperature and water mass structure are critical controls on water column production, organic carbon cycling and pelagic\textendash benthic coupling. Short food chains and shallow depths are characteristic of high productivity areas in this region, so changes in lower trophic levels can impact higher trophic organisms rapidly, including pelagic- and benthic-feeding marine mammals and seabirds. Subsistence harvesting of many of these animals is locally important for human consumption. The vulnerability of the ecosystem to environmental change is thought to be high, particularly as sea ice extent declines and seawater warms. In this review, we focus on ecosystem dynamics in the northern Bering and Chukchi Seas, with a more limited discussion of the adjoining Pacific-influenced eastern section of the East Siberian Sea and the western section of the Beaufort Sea. Both primary and secondary production are enhanced in specific regions that we discuss here, with the northern Bering and Chukchi Seas sustaining some of the highest water column production and benthic faunal soft-bottom biomass in the world ocean. In addition, these organic carbon-rich Pacific waters are periodically advected into low productivity regions of the nearshore northern Bering, Chukchi and Beaufort Seas off Alaska and sometimes into the East Siberian Sea, all of which have lower productivity on an annual basis. Thus, these near shore areas are intimately tied to nutrients and advected particulate organic carbon from the Pacific influenced Bering Shelf-Anadyr water. Given the short food chains and dependence of many apex predators on sea ice, recent reductions in sea ice in the Pacific-influenced sector of the Arctic have the potential to cause an ecosystem reorganization that may alter this benthic-oriented system to one more dominated by pelagic processes.},

We analysed seasonal and interannual variations of thawing-induced cliff top retreat (thermo-denudation) and marine abrasion (thermo-abrasion) on Muostakh Island in the southern central Laptev Sea. Geomorphometric analysis revealed that total ground ice content on Muostakh is made up of equal amounts of intrasedimentary and macro ground ice and sums up to 87\%, rendering the island particularly susceptible to erosion along the coast, resulting in land loss. Based on topographic reference measurements during field campaigns, we generated digital elevation models using stereophotogrammetry, in order to block-adjust and orthorectify aerial photographs from 1951 and GeoEye, QuickBird, WorldView-1, and WorldView-2 imagery from 2010 to 2013 for change detection. Using sea ice concentration data from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) and air temperature time series from nearby Tiksi, we calculated the seasonal duration available for thermo-abrasion, expressed as open water days, and for thermo-denudation, based on the number of days with positive mean daily temperatures. Seasonal dynamics of cliff top retreat revealed rapid thermo-denudation rates of \&minus;10.2 {$\pm$} 4.5 m a\textsuperscript{\&minus;1} in mid-summer and thermo-abrasion rates along the coastline of \&minus;3.4 {$\pm$} 2.7 m a\textsuperscript{\&minus;1} on average during the 2010\textendash 2013 observation period, currently almost twice as rapid as the mean rate of \&minus;1.8 {$\pm$} 1.3 m a\textsuperscript{\&minus;1} since 1951. Our results showed a close relationship between mean summer air temperature and coastal thermo-erosion rates, in agreement with observations made for various permafrost coastlines different to the East Siberian Ice Complex coasts elsewhere in the Arctic. Seasonality of coastline retreat and interannual variations of environmental factors suggest that an increasing length of thermo-denudation and thermo-abrasion process simultaneity favours greater coastal erosion. Coastal thermo-erosion has reduced the island's area by 0.9 km\textsuperscript{2} (24\%) over the past 62 years but shrank its volume by 28 x 10\textsuperscript{6} m\textsuperscript{3} (40\%), not least because of permafrost thaw subsidence, with the most pronounced with rates of \&geq;\&minus; 11 cm a\textsuperscript{\&minus;1} on yedoma uplands near the island's rapidly eroding northern cape. Recent acceleration in both will halve Muostakh Island's lifetime to less than a century.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Concentrations of total organic carbon (TOC) decreased from 3010 {$\lnot$}\textmu M in mid-May to 608 {$\lnot$}\textmu M in September, accompanying an increase in river water d18O from the snowmelt to summer and early fall. COC was the predominant OC species, comprising, on average, 63 {$\surd$}\c{C}{$\lnot\pm$} 8\% of the TOC, with 23 {$\surd$}\c{C}{$\lnot\pm$} 5\% partitioned in the LMW-DOC and 14 {$\surd$}\c{C}{$\lnot\pm$} 5\% in the POC fraction. Annual riverine export flux to the ocean was 2.02 {$\surd$}\'E,\"A\^i 1012 g-C for TOC, 7.66 {$\surd$}\'E,\"A\^i 1010 g-N for total organic nitrogen (TON), and 3.53 {$\surd$}\'E,\"A\^i 1012 g-C for dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), respectively. The C/N molar ratios were distinctly different between colloidal organic matter (COM, 46 {$\surd$}\c{C}{$\lnot\pm$} 3) and particulate organic matter (POM, 15 {$\surd$}\c{C}{$\lnot\pm$} 1.4). Similar d13C values were found for LMW-DOM (-27.9 {$\surd$}\c{C}{$\lnot\pm$} 0.5,\"A{$\infty$}), COM (-27.4 {$\surd$}\c{C}{$\lnot\pm$} 0.2,\"A{$\infty$}), and POM (-26.2 {$\surd$}\c{C}{$\lnot\pm$} 0.7,\"A{$\infty$}), although there was a general increase with increasing size, suggesting a common terrigenous organic source. In contrast, distinct ?14C values were found for LMW-DOC (-155 to +91,\"A{$\infty$}), COC (40 to 140,\"A{$\infty$}), and POC (-467 to -253,\"A{$\infty$}) with a decreasing trend from snowmelt to ice-open season, suggesting that turnover pathways and transport mechanisms vary with organic matter size fractions. The high abundance of COC and its contemporary 14C ages points to a predominant source from modern terrestrial primary production, likely from the leaching/decomposition of fresh plant litter in the upper soil horizon. The predominately old POC (average 3698 {$\surd$}\c{C}{$\lnot\pm$} 902 years B.P.), in contrast, was largely derived from riverbank erosion and melting of permafrost. These results imply that ice-opening Yukon River flows are dominated by snowmelt (low d18O) with high DOC (high ?14C) but low DIC and Si(OH)4 concentrations, whereas late summer flows contain more products of permafrost or ice melt and rain (high d18O), with low DOC (low ?14C) but high DIC and Si(OH)4 concentrations. A warming climate with a deeper permafrost active layer in the Yukon River watershed would enhance the mobilization and export of old terrestrial OC, but largely in the particulate form into the Bering Sea and Arctic Ocean.},

Record discharges on the Patuxent and its tributary, the Little Patuxent, were recorded on September II, 1971, and June 22, 1972, respectively. Among the more striking effects were destruction of floodplain vegetation, widening of stream channels, and clearing of the channels of all but very coarse materials. Low and medium flows succeeding each flood reduced enlarged channel widths by building up bar remnants with fines and forming new bars along channel margins, tending to destroy the evidence of such floods. Channels preserve flood-originated forms when high-magnitude floods occur with sufficient regularity.},

  abstract = {As the pressure on water is increasing, the risk that the required amounts of water will not be available is also increasing in many semi-arid areas. Interbasin water transfers are designed to secure access by artificially conveying water to locations where people need it. These are typical supply oriented engineering measures to large societal challenges. The engineering works are frequently daunting, involving diversion works, tunnels and/or large pumping schemes and reservoirs, and the costs are correspondingly large. The scale of engineering works and funds required are indicative of the magnitude of the needs and interests to be served. Interbasin water transfers trigger pertinent questions from different interests groups and communities involved and affected. This paper assesses the phenomenon of interbasin water transfers from a multi-disciplinary perspective, and attempts to answer the question whether such transfers are compatible with the concept of integrated water resources management. The problems related to interbasin water transfers are first introduced by reviewing four selected interbasin transfers taking place in different parts of the world. Then the criteria for assessing such transfers as proposed by international commissions, policy communities and scientists are reviewed, from which a coherent set of evaluation criteria are distilled for interbasin transfer schemes. This set of criteria is subsequently applied to the River Linking project in India, in order to provide a preliminary assessment. This is followed by a discussion of the temporal, spatial and resource scale effects, and finally conclusions are drawn about the required institutional capacity to control water and to adapt to changing policy environments.},

Past research has studied the meander dynamics by using the centerline (short-term frame) and the valley centerline (long-term frame). The present study introduces a medium term frame, termed the mean center (MC), which is defined as the medium term coherent wave being present in the meander planimetry for a period that is strongly governed by the occurrence of cutoff events; although in the absence of them, it is present for {$\sim$}10 to {$\sim$}30 years. The MC is obtained by using a methodology that combines the capabilities of the principal component analysis and the discrete wavelet transforms. The application of wavelet cross correlation shows that peaks in the centerline curvature are strongly correlated with those of the MC suggesting that (1) a linear relationship between them may be associated to bank processes and, (2) in all other cases, a higher nonlinear relationship may be induced by autogenic hydrodynamic processes. In freely meandering rivers, compound bends, multiple loops, and cutoff events are associated to peaks in the MC local curvature. We define the planform amplitudes as the orthogonal distance of the centerline from mean center. Planform amplitudes (orthogonal distance of the centerline from mean center) are normally distributed and ranges from 2 to 20 river mean widths.},

Sediment loads decrease from the piedmont to Villabella (250-300 x 106 t year4) because substantial deposition occurs on the flood plain.

The role of enhanced horizontal resolution in improved process representation in all components of the climate system is of growing interest, particularly as some recent simulations suggest both the possibility of significant changes in large-scale aspects of circulation as well as improvements in small-scale processes and extremes. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} However, such high-resolution global simulations at climate timescales, with resolutions of at least 50km in the atmosphere and 0.25\textdegree{} in the ocean, have been performed at relatively few research centres and generally without overall coordination, primarily due to their computational cost. Assessing the robustness of the response of simulated climate to model resolution requires a large multi-model ensemble using a coordinated set of experiments. The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) is the ideal framework within which to conduct such a study, due to the strong link to models being developed for the CMIP DECK experiments and other model intercomparison projects (MIPs). {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} Increases in high-performance computing (HPC) resources, as well as the revised experimental design for CMIP6, now enable a detailed investigation of the impact of increased resolution up to synoptic weather scales on the simulated mean climate and its variability. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} The High Resolution Model Intercomparison Project (HighResMIP) presented in this paper applies, for the first time, a multi-model approach to the systematic investigation of the impact of horizontal resolution.

The set of HighResMIP experiments is divided into three tiers consisting of atmosphere-only and coupled runs and spanning the period 1950\textendash 2050, with the possibility of extending to 2100, together with some additional targeted experiments. This paper describes the experimental set-up of HighResMIP, the analysis plan, the connection with the other CMIP6 endorsed MIPs, as well as the DECK and CMIP6 historical simulations.

The reforecast dataset consists of an 11-member ensemble run once each day from 0000 UTC initial conditions. Reforecasts are run to +16 days. As with the operational 2012 GEFS, the reforecast is run at T254L42 resolution (approximately 1/2\textdegree{} grid spacing, 42 levels) for week +1 forecasts and T190L42 (approximately 3/4\textdegree{} grid spacing) for the week +2 forecasts. Reforecasts were initialized with Climate Forecast System Reanalysis initial conditions, and perturbations were generated using the ensemble transform with rescaling technique. Reforecast data are available from 1985 to present. Reforecast datasets were previously demonstrated to be very valuable for detecting and correcting systematic errors in forecasts, especially forecasts of relatively rare events and longer-lead forecasts. What is novel about this reforecast dataset relative to the first-generation NOAA reforecast is that (i) a modern, currently operational version of the forecast model is used (the previous reforecast used a model version from 1998); (ii) a much larger set of output data has been saved, including variables relevant for precipitation, hydrologic, wind energy, solar energy, severe weather, and tropical cyclone forecasting; and (iii) the archived data are at much higher resolution.

RASM reproduces the dominant features of the land surface climatology in the Arctic, such as the amount and regional distribution of precipitation, the partitioning of precipitation between runoff and evapotranspiration, the effects of snow on the water and energy balance, and the differences in turbulent fluxes between the tundra and taiga biomes. Surface air temperature biases in RASM, compared to reanalysis datasets ERA-Interim and MERRA, are generally less than 2\textdegree C; however, in the cold seasons there are local biases that exceed 6\textdegree C. Compared to satellite observations, RASM captures the annual cycle of snow-covered area well, although melt progresses about two weeks faster than observations in the late spring at high latitudes. With respect to derived fluxes, such as latent heat or runoff, RASM is shown to have similar performance statistics as ERA-Interim while differing substantially from MERRA, which consistently overestimates the evaporative flux across the Arctic region.},

  abstract = {This study employs the concepts of complex networks to study the temporal dynamics of streamflow, with emphasis on annual scale (i.e., year-to-year connections). The study proposes a new approach to construct the streamflow network at the annual scale. It uses the daily streamflow data to construct the annual streamflow network, instead of using the annual (mean or accumulated) streamflow data. With this approach, each year serves as a node in the network, with each node having a time series of daily streamflow values (not a single streamflow value). Streamflow data observed over a period of 151~years (October 1862\textendash September 2013) from the Mississippi River basin at St. Louis, Missouri, USA are considered for implementation of the approach. The properties of the annual streamflow network are investigated using three complex network-based methods: degree centrality, clustering coefficient, and degree distribution. The sensitivity of the results to streamflow correlation threshold is also examined. The results suggest that (1) there are only a few very significant nodes (years) in the annual streamflow network (degree centrality method); (2) the annual streamflow network is not a classical random graph, but may be a small-world network or scale-free network (clustering coefficient method); and (3) the network exhibits a combination of exponential and power-law distribution (degree distribution method). Based on the identification of a significant stretch of period (around the 1950s\textendash 1990s) with very weak connections with the rest of the period studied, the results also suggest the influence of dam construction (and other anthropogenic factors) on the evolution of annual streamflow dynamics.},

  abstract = {Freshwater faunal diversity and abundance have declined dramatically worldwide, concurrent with changes in streamflow and sediment loads in rivers. Cumulative effects and interdependencies of chronic covarying environmental stressors can obscure causal linkages that may be controlling the population dynamics of longer-lived freshwater fauna, such as mussels. To understand changes in long-term mussel population density, we developed a dynamic, process-based interaction model that couples streamflow, suspended sediment, phytoplankton, and mussel abundance under the hypothesis that chronic exposure to increased suspended sediment and food limitation are the primary factors controlling native mussel population density in a midwestern USA agricultural river basin. We calibrated and validated the model with extensive survey data from multiple time periods and used it to evaluate changes in mussel abundance at a subbasin scale over decades. We evaluated sensitivity of simulated mussel densities across a range of mortality rates and initial population densities. In scenarios representing altered sediment concentrations, such as might occur with climate or landuse-induced changes in streamflow or sediment generation rates, mussel population density showed critical threshold responses to long-term changes in suspended sediment concentration. This model of mussel population density can be used to test hypotheses about limiting factors, identify priority locations for restoration activities, and evaluate the effects of climate- or landuse-change scenarios.},

The articles in this special issue demonstrate the ability of current approaches to forecast events of interest and contributes to the formulation of best practices for forecasting within peace research.

  abstract = {The exposure time is a water transport time scale defined as the cumulative amount of time a water parcel spends in the domain of interest regardless of the number of excursions from the domain. Transport time scales are often used to characterize the nutrient removal potential of aquatic systems, but exposure time distribution estimates are scarce for deltaic systems. Here we analyze the controls on exposure time distributions using a hydrodynamic model in two domains: the Wax Lake delta in Louisiana, USA, and an idealized channel-island complex. In particular, we study the effects of river discharge, vegetation, network geometry, and tides and use a simple model for the fractional removal of nitrate. In both domains, we find that channel-island hydrological connectivity significantly affects exposure time distributions and nitrate removal. The relative contributions of the island and channel portions of the delta to the overall exposure time distribution are controlled by island vegetation roughness and network geometry. Tides have a limited effect on the system's exposure time distribution but can introduce significant spatial variability in local exposure times. The median exposure time for the WLD model is 10 h under the conditions tested and water transport within the islands contributes to 37\textendash 50\% of the network-scale exposure time distribution and 52\textendash 73\% of the modeled nitrate removal, indicating that islands may account for the majority of nitrate removal in river deltas.},

  abstract = {Automatic extraction of channel networks from topography in systems with multiple interconnected channels, like braided rivers and estuaries, remains a major challenge in hydrology and geomorphology. Representing channelized systems as networks provides a mathematical framework for analyzing transport and geomorphology. In this paper, we introduce a mathematically rigorous methodology and software for extracting channel network topology and geometry from digital elevation models (DEMs) and analyze such channel networks in estuaries and braided rivers. Channels are represented as network links, while channel confluences and bifurcations are represented as network nodes. We analyze and compare DEMs from the field and those generated by numerical modeling. We use a metric called the volume parameter that characterizes the volume of deposited material separating channels to quantify the volume of reworkable sediment deposited between links, which is a measure for the spatial scale associated with each network link. Scale asymmetry is observed in most links downstream of bifurcations, indicating geometric asymmetry and bifurcation stability. The length of links relative to system size scales with volume parameter value to the power of 0.24\textendash 0.35, while the number of links decreases and does not exhibit power law behavior. Link depth distributions indicate that the estuaries studied tend to organize around a deep main channel that exists at the largest scale while braided rivers have channel depths that are more evenly distributed across scales. The methods and results presented establish a benchmark for quantifying the topology and geometry of multichannel networks from DEMs with a new automatic extraction tool.},

It is based on measured data of power, gross head, and water discharge recorded by the company that manages the plant operation. The objective is to determine the actual performance characteristics of the set: turbine, generator, and penstock. In order to obtain the efficiency functions, an iterative calculation is used. Its input data are the functions currently in use of turbine efficiency, generator efficiency, and penstock head losses. For the adjustment of the efficiency functions, the Generalized Reduced Gradient optimization method is employed. A case study was applied to the data from a large Brazilian hydroelectric plant whose operation is under the coordination of the Electric System National Operator. The benefits of the proposed methodology are analyzed using a simulation tool for the hydroelectric operation. The simulator is used to reproduce the past operation of the plant, first with current data and second with adjusted data. The results show that the optimal unit efficiency functions significantly contribute to bring the real and simulated operation closer.

  abstract = {The Arctic climate is changing. Permafrost is warming, hydrological processes are changing and biological and social systems are also evolving in response to these changing conditions. Knowing how the structure and function of arctic terrestrial ecosystems are responding to recent and persistent climate change is paramount to understanding the future state of the Earth system and how humans will need to adapt. Our holistic review presents a broad array of evidence that illustrates convincingly; the Arctic is undergoing a system-wide response to an altered climatic state. New extreme and seasonal surface climatic conditions are being experienced, a range of biophysical states and processes influenced by the threshold and phase change of freezing point are being altered, hydrological and biogeochemical cycles are shifting, and more regularly human sub-systems are being affected. Importantly, the patterns, magnitude and mechanisms of change have sometimes been unpredictable or difficult to isolate due to compounding factors. In almost every discipline represented, we show how the biocomplexity of the Arctic system has highlighted and challenged a paucity of integrated scientific knowledge, the lack of sustained observational and experimental time series, and the technical and logistic constraints of researching the Arctic environment. This study supports ongoing efforts to strengthen the interdisciplinarity of arctic system science and improve the coupling of large scale experimental manipulation with sustained time series observations by incorporating and integrating novel technologies, remote sensing and modeling.},

  abstract = {Despite the importance of Arctic and boreal regions in the present carbon cycle, estimates of annual high-latitude carbon fluxes vary in sign and magnitude. Without accurate estimates of current carbon fluxes from Arctic and boreal ecosystems, predicting the response of these systems to global change is daunting. A number of factors control carbon turnover in high-latitude soils, but because they are unique to northern systems, they are mostly ignored by biogeochemical models used to predict the response of these systems to global change. Here, we review those factors. First, many northern systems are dominated by mosses, whose extremely slow decomposition is not predicted by commonly used indices of litter quality. Second, cold temperature, permafrost, waterlogging and substrate quality interact to stabilize soil organic matter, but the relative importance of these factors, and how they respond to climate change, is unknown. Third, recent evidence suggests that biological activity occurring over winter can contribute significantly to annual soil carbon fluxes. However, the controls over this winter activity remain poorly understood. Finally, processes at the landscape stale, such as fire, permafrost dynamics, and drainage, control regional carbon fluxes, complicating the extrapolation of site-level measurements to regional scales.},

Models' monthly mean outputs are laterally integrated over two subdomains (Amerasian and Eurasian basins), then examined as functions of depth and time. Differences in such fields as averaged temperature and salinity arise from models' differences in parameterizations and numerical methods and from different domain sizes, with anomalies that develop at lower latitudes carried into the Arctic. A systematic deficiency is seen as AOMIP models tend to produce thermally stratified upper layers rather than the ``cold halocline'', suggesting missing physics perhaps related to vertical mixing or to shelf-basin exchanges. Flow fields pose a challenge for intercomparison. We introduce topostrophy, the vertical component of V\texttimes{$\nabla$}D where V is monthly mean velocity and {$\nabla$}D is the gradient of total depth, characterizing the tendency to follow topographic slopes. Positive topostrophy expresses a tendency for cyclonic ``rim currents''. Systematic differences of models' circulations are found to depend strongly upon assumed roles of unresolved eddies.},

Samples from the six largest arctic rivers, with a combined watershed area of 11.3 \texttimes{} 106 km2, have revealed strong seasonal variations in constituent concentrations and fluxes within rivers as well as large differences among the rivers. Specifically, we investigate fluxes of dissolved organic carbon, dissolved organic nitrogen, total dissolved phosphorus, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, nitrate, and silica. This is the first time that seasonal and annual constituent fluxes have been determined using consistent sampling and analytical methods at the pan-Arctic scale and consequently provide the best available estimates for constituent flux from land to the Arctic Ocean and surrounding seas. Given the large inputs of river water to the relatively small Arctic Ocean and the dramatic impacts that climate change is having in the Arctic, it is particularly urgent that we establish the contemporary river fluxes so that we will be able to detect future changes and evaluate the impact of the changes on the biogeochemistry of the receiving coastal and ocean systems.},

Different block failure modes with and without thermoerosional niches and ice wedges are identified. A comprehensive analytical model is developed by coupling slope stability analysis with the progressive formation of a thermoerosional niche and the existence of ice wedges in the perennially frozen backshore area. Model computations involve three steps. First, the stability of frozen cliffs is examined by calculating the factor of safety based on slope analysis using the strength of permafrost soil. Second, in the presence of thermoerosional niches at the base of frozen cliffs, the failure modes and critical niche depths are determined by applying the moving boundary of a developing thermoerosional niche to the stability analysis. Finally, the effects of ice wedges are examined by imposing a change in strength conditions related to the existence of ice wedges at different locations in the potential failure region. Different potential failure modes and the critical combination of features contributing to block failure occurrences in Arctic coastal bluffs are identified through model calculations. Nondimensional parameters, regression equations, and graphs are derived to be used for determining the block failure potential for Arctic coasts.},

Most of these models are the ocean and sea-ice components of the coupled climate models used in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) experiments. We mainly focus on the hydrography of the Arctic interior, the state of Atlantic Water layer and heat and volume transports at the gateways of the Davis Strait, the Bering Strait, the Fram Strait and the Barents Sea Opening. We found that there is a large spread in temperature in the Arctic Ocean between the models, and generally large differences compared to the observed temperature at intermediate depths. Warm bias models have a strong temperature anomaly of inflow of the Atlantic Water entering the Arctic Ocean through the Fram Strait. Another process that is not represented accurately in the CORE-II models is the formation of cold and dense water, originating on the eastern shelves. In the cold bias models, excessive cold water forms in the Barents Sea and spreads into the Arctic Ocean through the St. Anna Through. There is a large spread in the simulated mean heat and volume transports through the Fram Strait and the Barents Sea Opening. The models agree more on the decadal variability, to a large degree dictated by the common atmospheric forcing. We conclude that the CORE-II model study helps us to understand the crucial biases in the Arctic Ocean. The current coarse resolution state-of-the-art ocean models need to be improved in accurate representation of the Atlantic Water inflow into the Arctic and density currents coming from the shelves.},

The catchment soils appear adjusted to transmit all the rainfall they receive and a steady state condition is visualized. A high soil aggregate stability contributes to the resistance against erosion. This is particularly true of forest soils but a lower degree of aggregate stability under agriculture is, to some extent, compensated for by the stoniness of the soil. This explains the low output of suspended solids measured in the stream channel. On the other hand, erosion pin measurements indicate that some erosion does occur through frost and rainsplash action, even beneath forest, but only where bare soil is exposed. The lack of erosion suggested by the hydrological conditions and erosion and soil aggregate stability data, is corroborated by the continuing presence of Holocene Cambisols even on the steepest slopes. Their A3 or B1 horizon has been used to indicate the degree of erosion. These horizons originate from homogenisation as could be demonstrated by micromorfological methods and by the distribution of volcanic minerals. Beneath forest, complete profiles point to a lack of erosion except where occasionally colluvium reflects a local disturbance of the soils following woodcutting. The stability of the forest soils is largely due to the high porosity of the surface soil and to the high aggregate stability induced by the impregnation of plasma with organic matter. On agricultural land the clearance of woodland was followed by some erosion but this was nowhere catastrophic and the results are only apparent in the landscape behind terraces on steep land. \textcopyright{} 1973.},

To overcome this limitation, a regression model was applied to a 1 km gridded stream network of Germany to obtain estimated daily stream flow data (m3 s-1) spanning 64 years (1950\textendash 2013). The data are used as input to calculate hydrological indices characterizing stream flow regimes. Both temporal and spatial validations were performed. In addition, GLMs using both the calculated and observed hydrological indices were compared, suggesting that the predicted flow data are adequate for use in predictive ecological models. Accordingly, we provide estimated stream flow as well as a set of 53 hydrological metrics at 1 km grid for the stream network of Germany. In addition, we provide an R script where the presented methodology is implemented, that uses globally available data and can be directly applied to any other geographical region.},

  abstract = {Landfast ice covers large surface areas of the winter Siberian Seas. The immobile landfast ice cover inhibits divergent and convergent motion, hence dynamical sea ice growth and redistribution, decouples winter river plumes in coastal seas from the atmosphere, and positions polynyas at the landfast ice edge offshore. In spite of the potentially large effects, state-of-the-art numerical models usually do not represent landfast ice in its correct extent. A simple parametrization of landfast ice based on bathymetry and internal sea ice strength is introduced and its effects on the simulated Arctic Ocean are demonstrated. The simulations suggest that the Siberian landfast ice impacts the Arctic halocline stability through enhanced brine production in polynyas located closer to the shelf break and by redirecting river water to the Canadian Basin. These processes strengthen the halocline in the Canadian Basin, but erode its stability in the Makarov and Eurasian Basins.},

Streamflow is a mixture of young and old precipitation2, but the global proportions of these young and old components are not known. Here we analyse seasonal cycles of oxygen isotope ratios in rain, snow and streamflow compiled from 254 watersheds around the world, and calculate the fraction of streamflow that is derived from precipitation that fell within the past two or three months. This young streamflow accounts for about a third of global river discharge, and comprises at least 5\% of discharge in about 90\% of the catchments we investigated. We conclude that, although typical catchments have mean transit times of years or even decades3, they nonetheless can rapidly transmit substantial fractions of soluble contaminant inputs to streams. Young streamflow is less prevalent in steeper landscapes, which suggests they are characterized by deeper vertical infiltration. Because young streamflow is derived from less than 0.1\% of global groundwater storage, we conclude that this thin veneer of aquifer storage will have a disproportionate influence on stream water quality.},

  abstract = {The current coarse-resolution global Community Earth System Model (CESM) can reproduce major and large-scale patterns but is still missing some key biogeochemical features in the Arctic Ocean, e.g., low surface nutrients in the Canada Basin. We incorporated the CESM Version 1 ocean biogeochemical code into the Regional Arctic System Model (RASM) and coupled it with a sea-ice algal module to investigate model limitations. Four ice-ocean hindcast cases are compared with various observations: two in a global 1\textdegree{} (40{$\sim$}60 km in the Arctic) grid: G1deg and G1deg-OLD with/without new sea-ice processes incorporated; two on RASM's 1/12\textdegree{} ({$\sim$}9 km) grid R9km and R9km-NB with/without a subgrid scale brine rejection parameterization which improves ocean vertical mixing under sea ice. Higher-resolution and new sea-ice processes contributed to lower model errors in sea-ice extent, ice thickness, and ice algae. In the Bering Sea shelf, only higher resolution contributed to lower model errors in salinity, nitrate (NO3), and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a). In the Arctic Basin, model errors in mixed layer depth (MLD) were reduced 36\% by brine rejection parameterization, 20\% by new sea-ice processes, and 6\% by higher resolution. The NO3 concentration biases were caused by both MLD bias and coarse resolution, because of excessive horizontal mixing of high NO3 from the Chukchi Sea into the Canada Basin in coarse resolution models. R9km showed improvements over G1deg on NO3, but not on Chl-a, likely due to light limitation under snow and ice cover in the Arctic Basin.},

  abstract = {Eroding permafrost coasts are likely indicators and integrators of changes in the Arctic System as they are susceptible to the combined effects of declining sea ice extent, increases in open water duration, more frequent and impactful storms, sea-level rise, and warming permafrost. However, few observation sites in the Arctic have yet to link decadal-scale erosion rates with changing environmental conditions due to temporal data gaps. This study increases the temporal fidelity of coastal permafrost bluff observations using near-annual high spatial resolution (\textbackslash textless1 m) satellite imagery acquired between 2008\textendash 2017 for a 9 km segment of coastline at Drew Point, Beaufort Sea coast, Alaska. Our results show that mean annual erosion for the 2007\textendash 2016 decade was 17.2 m yr-1, which is 2.5 times faster than historic rates, indicating that bluff erosion at this site is likely responding to changes in the Arctic System. In spite of a sustained increase in decadal-scale mean annual erosion rates, mean open water season erosion varied from 6.7 m yr-1 in 2010 to more than 22.0 m yr-1 in 2007, 2012, and 2016. This variability provided a range of coastal responses through which we explored the different roles of potential environmental drivers. The lack of significant correlations between mean open water season erosion and the environmental variables compiled in this study indicates that we may not be adequately capturing the environmental forcing factors, that the system is conditioned by long-term transient effects or extreme weather events rather than annual variability, or that other not yet considered factors may be responsible for the increased erosion occurring at Drew Point. Our results highlight an increase in erosion at Drew Point in the 21st century as well as the complexities associated with unraveling the factors responsible for changing coastal permafrost bluffs in the Arctic.},

  abstract = {In order to produce useful hydrologic and aquatic habitat data from the Landsat system, the U.S. Geological Survey has developed the \&ldquo;Dynamic Surface Water Extent\&rdquo; (DSWE) Landsat Science Product. DSWE will provide long-term, high-temporal resolution data on variations in inundation extent. The model used to generate DSWE is composed of five decision-rule based tests that do not require scene-based training. To allow its general application, required inputs are limited to the Landsat at-surface reflectance product and a digital elevation model. Unlike other Landsat-based water products, DSWE includes pixels that are only partially covered by water to increase inundation dynamics information content. Previously published DSWE model development included one wetland-focused test developed through visual inspection of field-collected Everglades spectra. A comparison of that test\&rsquo;s output against Everglades Depth Estimation Network (EDEN) in situ data confirmed the expectation that omission errors were a prime source of inaccuracy in vegetated environments. Further evaluation exposed a tendency toward commission error in coniferous forests. Improvements to the subpixel level \&ldquo;partial surface water\&rdquo; (PSW) component of DSWE was the focus of this research. Spectral mixture models were created from a variety of laboratory and image-derived endmembers. Based on the mixture modeling, a more \&ldquo;aggressive\&rdquo; PSW rule improved accuracy in herbaceous wetlands and reduced errors of commission elsewhere, while a second \&ldquo;conservative\&rdquo; test provides an alternative when commission errors must be minimized. Replication of the EDEN-based experiments using the revised PSW tests yielded a statistically significant increase in mean overall agreement (4\%, p = 0.01, n = 50) and a statistically significant decrease (11\%, p = 0.009, n = 50) in mean errors of omission. Because the developed spectral mixture models included image-derived vegetation endmembers and laboratory spectra for soil groups found across the US, simulations suggest where the revised DSWE PSW tests perform as they do in the Everglades and where they may prove problematic. Visual comparison of DSWE outputs with an unusual variety of coincidently collected images for locations spread throughout the US support conclusions drawn from Everglades quantitative analyses and highlight DSWE PSW component strengths and weaknesses.},

  abstract = {Studies from 1994,\"A\`i1998 on the Tanana Flats in central Alaska reveal that permafrost degradation is widespread and rapid, causing large shifts in ecosystems from birch forests to fens and bogs. Fine-grained soils under the birch forest are ice-rich and thaw settlement typically is 1,\"A\`i2.5 m after the permafrost thaws. The collapsed areas are rapidly colonized by aquatic herbaceous plants, leading to the development of a thick, floating organic mat. Based on field sampling of soils, permafrost and vegetation, and the construction of a GIS database, we estimate that 17\% of the study area (263,964 ha) is unfrozen with no previous permafrost, 48\% has stable permafrost, 31\% is partially degraded, and 4\% has totally degraded. For that portion that currently has, or recently had, permafrost (83\% of area), 42\% has been affected by thermokarst development. Based on airphoto analysis, birch forests have decreased 35\% and fens have increased 29\% from 1949 to 1995. Overall, the area with totally degraded permafrost (collapse-scar fens and bogs) has increased from 39 to 47\% in 46 y. Based on rates of change from airphoto analysis and radiocarbon dating, we estimate 83\% of the degradation occurred before 1949. Evidence indicates this permafrost degradation began in the mid-1700s and is associated with periods of relatively warm climate during the mid-late 1700s and 1900s. If current conditions persist, the remaining lowland birch forests will be eliminated by the end of the next century.},

  abstract = {A regional classification of shoreline segments along the Alaskan Beaufort Sea Coast was developed as the basis for quantifying coastal morphology, lithology, and carbon and mineral sediment fluxes. We delineated 48 mainland segments totaling 1,957 km, as well as 1,334 km of spits and islands. Mainland coasts were grouped into five broad classes: exposed bluffs (313 km), bays and inlets (235 km), lagoons with barrier islands (546 km), tapped basins (171 km) and deltas (691 km). Sediments are mostly silts and sands, with occasional gravel, and bank heights generally are low (2\textendash 4 m), especially for deltas ({$<$}1 m). Mean annual erosion rates (MAER) by coastline type vary from 0.7 m/year (maximum 10.4 m/year) for lagoons to 2.4 m/year for exposed bluffs (maximum 16.7 m/year). MAERs are much higher in silty soils (3.2 m/year) than in sandy (1.2 m/year) to gravelly (-0.3 m/year) soils. Soil organic carbon along eroding shorelines (deltas excluded) range from 12 to 153 kg/m2 of bank surface down to the water line. We assume carbon flux out from depositional delta sediments is negligible. Across the entire Alaskan Beaufort Sea Coast, estimated annual carbon input from eroding shorelines ranges from \textendash 47 to 818 Mg/km/year (Metric tones/km/year) across the 48 segments, average 149 Mg/km/year (for 34 nondeltaic segments), and total 1.8\texttimes 105 Mg/year. Annual mineral input from eroding shorelines ranges from -1,863 (accreting) to 15,752 Mg/km/year, average 2,743 Mg/km/year, and totals 3.3 \texttimes 106 Mg/year.},

  abstract = {We evaluated the development of lake basins on the central coastal plain of northern Alaska on the basis of topographic profiles, soil and ground ice surveys, radiocarbon dating, photogrammetric analysis, and regional comparisons. Our analysis reveals that lake evolution is much more complex and less cyclic than theorized by previous investigations. In the area we studied, there was insufficient ground ice in the oldest terrain to form thaw lakes, the aggradation of ice in the margins of drained lake basins was insufficient to heave the surface up to near original topographic conditions, and the process occurs at too slow a rate for a {$\surd\cent$},\c{C}\textasciidieresis{$\approx$}\`ithaw lake cycle{$\surd\cent$},\c{C}\textasciidieresis{$\lnot$}\`u to develop within the Holocene. Accordingly, we revised the conceptual model of lake and basin development to be consistent with the patterns and process we observed on the extensive sand sheets underlying most of the coastal plain. Developmental stages include (1) initial flooding of depressions to form primary lakes, (2) lateral erosion, with sorting and redistribution of sediments, (3) lake drainage as the stream network expands, (4) differential ice aggradation in silty centers and sandy margins, (5) formation of secondary thaw lakes in the heaved centers of ice-rich basins and infilling of ponds along the low margins, and (6) basin stabilization.},

  abstract = {This study identifies and assesses the controls on hydraulic erosion of cohesive riverbanks on a 600-m reach of an urban ephemeral stream with active bank erosion. We examined hydraulic bank erosion by separating estimated bank shear stress into four properties: magnitude, duration, event peak, and variability. The values of these independent variables were used as a bank erosion context at three transects. Stepwise regression showed that the event peak (maximum peak) of excess shear stress best predicts cohesive bank erosion at the two transects with moderate critical shear stresses (1.93-4.08 N/m2), while the variability (all peaks) of excess shear stress best predicts erosion at the transect with low critical shear stress (0.95 N/m2). These results suggest that the amount of hydraulic erosion of cohesive riverbanks is dictated by flow peak intensities. Finally, the results of this study were combined with results from previous bank erosion studies to produce a conceptual model for estimating bank erosion rates based on their silt-clay content. \textcopyright{} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Soil temperature data were collected over a four-year period at a field site near Toolik Lake, Alaska. A finite-element, two-dimensional, heat conduction model with phase change was used to predict soil temperatures at the site. After verification that the model could be used with confidence to predict the soil thermal regime, various climatic warming scenarios were used as inputs to estimate the thermal response for the next fifty years. The impact of climatic warming on the thickness of the active layer is reported.},

The main terrain units in the studied area include (1) the primary surface of the coastal plain; (2) drained-lake basins; (3) low foothills (yedoma); (4) deltas and tidal flats; and (5) sand dunes. Wedge ice is the main type of massive ground ice, and ice-wedge polygons occurred on nearly all land surfaces. The volumetric content of wedge ice for the area varies from 3\% to 50\% between various terrain units with average value of about 11\% for the entire coast. The highest content of wedge ice (about 50\%) is typical of yedoma terrain, which occurred in a small segment at the coast of the Camden Bay. At the primary surface of the western region of the Arctic Coastal Plain, wedge-ice content reached almost 30\%, with an average value of about 14\%. Slightly smaller values were estimated for the primary surface of the eastern region of the Arctic Coastal Plain and for old drained-lake basins. Other types of massive ground ice included thermokarst-cave ice, ice cores of pingos, and a rare occurrence of folded massive ice at Barter Island. The content of segregated ice in organic and mineral soils between ice wedges was very high at most of the study sites. The total average volumetric ice content (due to wedge, segregated, and pore ice) for the whole area was 77\%, ranging from 43\% in eolian sand to 89\% in yedoma.},

Our study focused on the Svalbard Bank, an important feeding area for fishes and whales. In order to investigate how benthic community structure and benthic secondary production vary across environmental gradients and through time, we sampled across the bank and compared results with a similar study conducted 85 years ago. Considerable variability in community structure and function across bank corresponded with differences in the physical structure of the habitat, including currents, sedimentation regimes and sediment type, and overlying water masses. Despite an intensive scallop fishery and climatic shifts that have taken place since the last survey in the 1920s, benthic community structure was very similar to that from the previous survey, suggesting strong system resilience. Primary and secondary production over shallow banks plays a large role in the Barents Sea and may act as a carbon subsidy to surrounding fish populations, of which many are of commercial importance.},

  abstract = {In a changing climate with a warming trend in air temperature, river water temperature increases as a result of heat exchange with the atmosphere. Moreover, of the different types of anthropogenic activity impacting rivers, the construction of dams appears to have multi-dimensional effects on the river environment, and it especially affects the thermal condition of rivers. The aim of the study is to identify and assess the impact of these two distinct sources of water temperature distortion in relation to the natural thermal conditions of rivers. In the study, linear trend analysis and a complex wavelet transform are used. The analysis focuses on daily river water temperature data for time periods before and after the construction of selected reservoirs in the Polish Carpathians, and on daily air temperature data for neighboring meteorological stations. Three rivers were selected for analysis: (1) Dunajec River, 22km downstream of the Czorsztyn\textendash Sromowce Wy\.zne reservoir complex, (2) Ropa River, 16km downstream of the Klimk\'owka Reservoir, and (3) Wis\l ok River, 33km downstream of the Besko Reservoir. Research has shown that the significant increasing trends identified for water temperature are weaker than analogous trends in air temperature. The Czorsztyn\textendash Sromowce Wy\.zne and Klimk\'owka reservoirs appear to exert considerable influence on natural air\textendash water temperature synchronization, because the phase difference increases 5-fold in comparison with conditions prior to the construction of the reservoirs. The weakening of the natural air\textendash water temperature synchrony implies diminished impact of air temperature on stream water temperature. However, this creates an opportunity for preparing appropriate management practices mitigating an increasing temperature trend in order to shape more favorable (natural) thermal conditions for native aquatic biota in impounded rivers.},

The texture of deposits varied from natural levee sediments with 68 percent sand to backswamp sediments with 97 percent silt and clay. The amount of lateral erosion of bordering Pleistocene bluffs increased 271 percent over the previous 9 yr of record because of the flood.

The erosion data were analyzed using a stepwise multiple regression analysis to determine the conditions controlling the amount and distribution of bluff erosion. The results indicate a pattern of decreasing bluff erosion that is attributed to downstream migration of the zone of maximum basal scour. Bluff retreat in the period of active basal undercutting (1971 to mid-1975) was 18.9m/year and in the following period of decreased basal scour activity (mid-1975 to mid-1980) was 6.8m/year. Approximately, 61\% of the erosion was associated with rising river levels. The data also indicated that 66\% of the erosion occurred at bankfull discharge stage or above. Conditions that produce bluff erosion were found to vary between the two eriosion periods and also as river levels rose or fell in each of the periods. During the actively undercutting period, precipitation rate and amount of river rise explained 94\% of the bank erosion that occurred as river levels rose. During the falling river phase, days above bankfull stage and amount of river fall accounted for 99\% of the bluff erosion. In the period of decreased basal scour, precipitation rate and maximum river stage accounted for 94\% of the bluff erosion related to rising river levels, while the erosion during falling river levels could be only tentatively correlated to precipitation rate and factors associated with drawdown. Changes in slope processes as the result of decreased basal scour were also examined.},

The performance of the CMIP5 models in simulating 20-year temperature and precipitation extremes is comparable to that of the CMIP3 ensemble. The models simulate late 20th century warm extremes reasonably well, compared to estimates from reanalyses. The model discrepancies in simulating cold extremes are generally larger than those for warm extremes. Simulated late 20th century precipitation extremes are plausible in the extratropics but uncertainty in extreme precipitation in the tropics and subtropics remains very large, both in the models and the observationally-constrained datasets. Consistent with CMIP3 results, CMIP5 cold extremes generally warm faster than warm extremes, mainly in regions where snow and sea-ice retreat with global warming. There are tropical and subtropical regions where warming rates of warm extremes exceed those of cold extremes. Relative changes in the intensity of precipitation extremes generally exceed relative changes in annual mean precipitation. The corresponding waiting times for late 20th century extreme precipitation events are reduced almost everywhere, except for a few subtropical regions. The CMIP5 planetary sensitivity in extreme precipitation is about 6 \%/\textdegree C, with generally lower values over extratropical land.},

There is a significant gradient in salinity within this estuarine system that influences the growth and distribution of phytoplankton as well as the abundance and migration of shrimp and fish population. Several government agencies which have jurisdictions over this area are attempting to gather extensive data for effectively monitoring of this estuary. Repetitive remotely sensed data acquired from Landsat may be considered by these agencies as having the potential to provide a cost-effective method for gathering and processing water quality related data. In this study, Landsat multispectral scanner (MSS) data and color and color infrared photographs acquired from a U-2 aircraft were combined with surface measurements for salinity mapping of the San Francisco Bay Delta. The salinity measurements and U-2 photography were obtained simultaneously and coincident with landsat overpass. A regression model was developed between the surface truth data and Landsat digital data for 29 preselected sample sites and was then extended to the entire study area. The results included a salinity map of the study area and the statistical summaries. The results were in general agreement with the reported distribution of salinity values in the literature for the same time of the year. Based on the results and the associated analyses of natural color and color infrared photographs and Landsat color composite imagery, it was concluded that: (1) it was virtually impossible, at least within this test site, to establish any quantitative judgement regarding the salinity values by visual interpretation of the imagery; and (2) the present study constitutes the first effort to successfully use Landsat digital data for salinity mapping, by means of digital processing, for this geographic area.},

  abstract = {Seasonal mean temperature, precipitation and wind speed over Europe are analysed in an ensemble of 16 regional climate model (RCM) simulations for 1961\textendash 2100. The RCM takes boundary conditions from seven global climate models (GCMs) under four emission scenarios. One GCM was run three times under one emission scenario differing only in initial conditions. The ensemble is used to; (i) evaluate the simulated climate for 1961\textendash 1990, (ii) assess future climate change and (iii) illustrate uncertainties in future climate change related to natural variability, boundary conditions and emissions. Biases in the 1961\textendash 1990 period are strongly related to errors in the large-scale circulation in the GCMs. Significant temperature increases are seen for all of Europe already in the next decades. Precipitation increases in northern and decreases in southern Europe with a zone in between where the sign of change is uncertain. Wind speed decreases in many areas with exceptions in the northern seas and in parts of the Mediterranean in summer. Uncertainty largely depends on choice of GCM and their representation of changes in the large-scale circulation. The uncertainty related to forcing is most important by the end of the century while natural variability sometimes dominates the uncertainty in the nearest few decades.},

  abstract = {Copyright \textcopyright{} 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.Streambank retreat is a complex cyclical process involving subaerial processes, fluvial erosion, seepage erosion, and geotechnical failures and is driven by several soil properties that themselves are temporally and spatially variable. Therefore, it can be extremely challenging to predict and model the erosion and consequent retreat of streambanks. However, modeling streambank retreat has many important applications, including the design and assessment of mitigation strategies for stream revitalization and stabilization. In order to highlight the current complexities of modeling streambank retreat and to suggest future research areas, this paper reviewed one of the most comprehensive streambank retreat models available, the Bank Stability and Toe Erosion Model (BSTEM), which has recently been integrated with several popular hydrodynamic and sediment transport models including the Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System (HEC-RAS). The objectives of this paper were to: (i) comprehensively review studies that have utilized BSTEM and report their findings, (ii) address the limitations of the model so that it can be applied appropriately in its current form, and (iii) suggest directions of research that will help make the model a more useful tool in future applications. The paper includes an extensive overview of peer reviewed studies to guide future users of BSTEM. The review demonstrated that the model needs further testing and evaluation outside of the central United States. Also, further development is needed in terms of accounting for spatial and temporal variability in geotechnical and fluvial erodibility parameters, incorporating subaerial processes, and accounting for the influence of riparian vegetation on streambank pore-water pressure dynamics, applied shear stress, and erodibility parameters.

  abstract = {Small meandering channels of about 1 m wide on an intertidal mudflat in the Westerschelde estuary the Netherlands) were studied with the aim to improve understanding of the effect of highly cohesive bed and bank sediment on channel inception and meander geometry and dynamics. The study is supported by experiments and modelling. The estuarine meandering channels are less dynamical than alluvial meandering rivers, and the dynamics are more localised. Moreover, the high thresholds for bed sediment erosion and for bank failure lead to two processes, uncommon in larger rivers, that cause most of the morphological change. First, the beds of the channels are eroded by backward migrating steps under hydraulic jumps, while the remainder of the bed surface along the channel is hardly eroded. Second, channel banks erode i) where eroding steps locally cause undercutting of otherwise stable channel banks and ii) in very sharp bends where the flow separates from the inner-bend channel boundary and impinges directly on the bank on the opposite side of the channel. Further morphological change is probably induced by rainfall splash erosion and by storm waves that weaken the mud, and by large mud fluxes from the estuary. The steps were successfully reproduced in laboratory flume experiments. An existing model for step migration predicted celerities consistent with field and laboratory observations and demonstrated a strong dependence on the threshold for erosion. Bank stability models confirm that banks and steps only fail when undercut and weakened by waves, rain or excess pore pressure in agreement with observations. The effects of a high threshold for bank erosion was implemented in an existing meander simulation model that reproduced the observed locations of bank erosion somewhat better than without the threshold, but flow separation and its effect on meander bends remains poorly understood. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Drainage networks on terrains have been studied extensively from an algorithmic perspective. However, in drainage networks water flow cannot bifurcate and hence they do not model braided rivers (multiple channels which split and join, separated by sediment bars). We initiate the algorithmic study of braided rivers by employing the descending quasi Morse-Smale complex on the river bed (a polyhedral terrain), and extending it with a certain ordering of bars from the one river bank to the other. This allows us to compute a graph that models a representative channel network, consisting of lowest paths. To ensure that channels in this network are sufficiently different we define a sand function that represents the volume of sediment separating them. We show that in general the problem of computing a maximum network of non-crossing channels which are {$\delta$}-different from each other (as measured by the sand function) is NP-hard. However, using our ordering between the river banks, we can compute a maximum {$\delta$}-different network that respects this order in polynomial time. We implemented our approach and applied it to simulated and real-world braided rivers.},

  abstract = {Sea surface salinity (SSS) is critical for studying biological and physical processes in the ocean, such as the global water balance, ocean currents, and evaporation rates. The water and heat fluxes associated with precipitation and evaporation over global oceans are fundamental in regulating climate and weather. Yet measurements of global SSSs are sparse and do not show the required temporal and spatial variability of SSS distributions. Airborne microwave radiometers, such as the Scanning Low-Frequency Microwave Radiometer (SLFMR) and the Salinity, Temperature, and Roughness Remote Scanner (STARRS), have been used successfully to map SSS and its variability, but only in estuaries and coastal waters. Since 2009, SSS has been measured from satellite orbit by the European Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite, which is designed to provide synthesized SSS maps with a high accuracy. Other salinity-related satellites are being developed, such as Aquarius, which will provide the global view of salinity variability needed for climate studies. The objectives of this paper are to review remote sensing techniques for mapping SSS and to demonstrate the application of microwave radiometry by presenting two case studies.},

  abstract = {Human activities have increased nitrate export from rivers, degrading coastal water quality. At deltaic river mouths, the flow of water through wetlands increases nitrate removal, and the spatial organization of removal rates influences coastal water quality. To understand the spatial distribution of nitrate removal in a river-dominated delta, we deployed 23 benthic chambers across ecogeomorphic zones with varying elevation, vegetation, and sediment properties in Wax Lake Delta (Louisiana, USA) in June 2018. Regression analyses indicate that normalized difference vegetation index is a useful predictor of summertime nitrate removal. Mass transfer velocity were approximately three times greater on a vegetated submerged levee (13 mm hr-1), where normalized difference vegetation index was greatest, compared to other locations (4.6 mm hr-1). Two methods were developed to upscale nitrate removal across the delta. The flooded-delta method integrates spatially explicit potential removal rates across submerged portions of the delta and suggests that intermediate elevations on the delta\textemdash including submerged levees\textemdash are responsible for 70\% of potential nitrate removal despite covering only 33\% of the flooded area. The channel network method treats the delta as a network of river channels and suggests that although secondary channels are more efficient than primary channels at removing received nitrate, primary channels collectively contribute more to overall removal because they convey more of the total nitrate load. The two upscaling methods predict similar rates of nitrate removal, equivalent to less than 4\% of nitrate entering the delta. To protect coastal waters against high nitrate loads, management policies should aim to reduce upstream nutrient loads.},

  abstract = {By trapping sediment in reservoirs, dams interrupt the continuity of sediment transport through rivers, resulting in loss of reservoir storage and reduced usable life, and depriving downstream reaches of sediments essential for channel form and aquatic habitats. With the acceleration of new dam construction globally, these impacts are increasingly widespread. There are proven techniques to pass sediment through or around reservoirs, to preserve reservoir capacity and to minimize downstream impacts, but they are not applied in many situations where they would be effective. This paper summarizes collective experience from five continents in managing reservoir sediments and mitigating downstream sediment starvation. Where geometry is favorable it is often possible to bypass sediment around the reservoir, which avoids reservoir sedimentation and supplies sediment to downstream reaches with rates and timing similar to pre-dam conditions. Sluicing (or drawdown routing) permits sediment to be transported through the reservoir rapidly to avoid sedimentation during high flows; it requires relatively large capacity outlets. Drawdown flushing involves scouring and re-suspending sediment deposited in the reservoir and transporting it downstream through low-level gates in the dam; it works best in narrow reservoirs with steep longitudinal gradients and with flow velocities maintained above the threshold to transport sediment. Turbidity currents can often be vented through the dam, with the advantage that the reservoir need not be drawn down to pass sediment. In planning dams, we recommend that these sediment management approaches be utilized where possible to sustain reservoir capacity and minimize environmental impacts of dams.},

The ITP instrument consists of three components: a surface subsystem that sits atop an ice floe; a weighted, plastic-jacketed wire-rope tether of arbitrary length (up to 800 m) suspended from the surface element; and an instrumented underwater unit that employs a traction drive to profile up and down the wire tether. ITPs profile the water column at a programmed sampling interval; after each profile, the underwater unit transfers two files holding oceanographic and engineering data to the surface unit using an inductive modem and from the surface instrument to a shore-based data server using an Iridium transmitter. The surface instrument also accumulates battery voltage readings, buoy temperature data, and locations from a GPS receiver at a specified interval (usually every hour) and transmits those data daily. Oceanographic and engineering data are processed, displayed, and made available in near\textendash real time (available online at http://www.whoi.edu/itp). Six ITPs were deployed in the Arctic Ocean between 2004 and 2006 in the Beaufort gyre with various programmed sampling schedules of two to six one-way traverses per day between 10- and 750\textendash 760-m depth, providing more than 5300 profiles in all seasons (as of July 2007). The acquired CTD profile data document interesting spatial variations in the major water masses of the Canada Basin, show the double-diffusive thermohaline staircase that lies above the warm, salty Atlantic layer, measure seasonal surface mixed layer deepening, and document several mesoscale eddies. Augmenting the systems already deployed and to replace expiring systems, an international array of more than one dozen ITPs will be deployed as part of the Arctic Observing Network during the International Polar Year (IPY) period (2007\textendash 08) holding promise for more valuable real-time upper ocean observations for operational needs, to support studies of ocean processes, and to facilitate numerical model initialization and validation.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Eddy covariance data from regional flux networks are direct \emph{in situ} measurement of carbon, water, and energy fluxes and are of vital importance for understanding the spatio-temporal dynamics of the the global carbon cycle. FLUXNET links regional networks of eddy covariance sites across the globe to quantify the spatial and temporal variability of fluxes at regional to global scales and to detect emergent ecosystem properties. This study presents an assessment of the representativeness of FLUXNET based on the recently released FLUXNET2015 data set. We present a detailed high resolution analysis of the evolving representativeness of FLUXNET through time. Results provide quantitative insights into the extent that various biomes are sampled by the network of networks, the role of the spatial distribution of the sites on the network scale representativeness at any given time, and how that representativeness has changed through time due to changing operational status and data availability at sites in the network. To realize the full potential of FLUXNET observations for understanding emergent ecosystem properties at regional and global scales, we present an approach for upscaling eddy covariance measurements. Informed by the representativeness of observations at the flux sites in the network, the upscaled data reflects the spatio-temporal dynamics of the carbon cycle captured by the \emph{in situ} measurements. This study presents a method for optimal use of the rich point measurements from FLUXNET to derive an understanding of upscaled carbon fluxes, which can be routinely updated as new data become available, and direct network expansion by identifying regions poorly sampled by the current network. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} Data from this study are available at {$<$}a href=" http://dx.doi.org/10.15486/NGT/1279968"target="\_blank"{$>$}http://dx.doi.org/10.15486/NGT/1279968{$<$}/a{$><$}/p{$>$}},

A time series of flood information, over 25 years, collected by the Dartmouth Flood Observatory, is used to describe the spatio-temporal variability of large floods in Europe. Direct factors responsible for changes in flood severity and magnitude over time may be related to both climate and ground surface changes. Indirect links between flood severity/magnitude and socio-economic indices occur via flood risk reduction activities, land-use change and land-cover change.

Three approaches are used to identify near-sea-surface tiepoints. Thin ice or open water samples in new openings, typically within 1-2 cm of the sea surface, are used to assess the sea surface estimates. Results suggest that our retrieval procedures could provide consistent freeboard estimates along 25-km segments with uncertainties of better than 7 cm. Basin-scale composites of sea ice freeboard show a clear delineation of the seasonal ice zone in the fall. Overall, the mean freeboards of multiyear (MY) and first-year (FY) ice are 35 cm and 14 cm in the fall, and 43 cm and 27 cm in the winter. The increases of {$\sim$}9 cm and {$\sim$}12 cm on MY and FY sea ice are associated with the 4 months of ice growth and snow accumulation between data acquisitions. Since changes in snow depth account for {$>$}90\% of the seasonal increase in freeboard on MY ice, it dominates the seasonal signal. Our freeboard estimates are within 10 cm of those derived from available snow/ice thickness measurements from ice mass balance buoys. Examination of the two residual elevations fields, after the removal of the sea ice freeboard contribution, shows coherent spatial patterns with a standard deviation (S.D.) of {$\sim$}23 cm. Differencing them reduces the variance and gives a near random field with a mean of {$\sim$}2 cm and a standard deviation of {$\sim$}14 cm. While the residual fields seem to be dominated by the static component of unexplained sea surface height and mean dynamic topography (S.D. {$\sim$}23 cm), the difference field reveals the magnitude of the time-varying components as well as noise in the ICESat elevations (S.D. {$\sim$}10 cm).},

We focus both on the impact of these climatic changes on the global hydrological cycle and on the amplitude of the increase of global and continental runoff over the last century, in relation to measured temperature increases. In this contribution, we propose an original statistical wavelet-based method for the reconstruction of the monthly discharges of worldwide largest rivers. This method provides a data-based approximation of the evolution of the annual continental and global runoffs over the last century. A consistent correlation is highlighted between global annual temperature and runoff, suggesting a 4\% global runoff increase by 1 \textdegree C global temperature rise. However, this global trend should be qualified at the regional scale where both increasing and decreasing trends are identified. North America runoffs appear to be the most sensitive to the recent climatic changes. Finally, this contribution provides the first experimental data-based evidence demonstrating the link between the global warming and the intensification of the global hydrological cycle. This corresponds to more intense evaporation over oceans coupled to continental precipitation increase or continental evaporation decrease. This process finally leads to an increase of the global continental runoff.},

In this region, thaw slumps include a near-vertical headwall, a floor of low gradient (2?10{$\lnot\infty$}) and a steeply sloping evacuation channel (15-25{$\lnot\infty$}) that connects the floor of the thaw slumps to Willow River located 60-150?m below. All thaw slumps on the Aklavik Plateau are located within the glacial limit of the Laurentide Ice Sheet and the majority developed on the western side of the valley on gently sloping terrain. Aerial photographic analysis showed an increase in thaw slump initiation from 0.35 new thaw slump yr?1 over the 1954-71 period to 0.68 new thaw slump yr?1 over the 1985-2004 period. This increase follows the pattern of the 10-year running mean summer air temperature record over the 1950?2004 period. However, the total number of active mature thaw slumps on the Aklavik Plateau decreased from a maximum of 46 in 1950 to a minimum of 24 observed in 2004, which follows, to a certain extent, the 10-year running average of rainfall. Both these trends may relate to the influence of climate on the erosional processes that are thought to initiate thaw slumps and keep them active in regions of highlands.},

Using observations from satellite sensors and output from global land surface models, it is possible to study these under-observed river basins. With populations greater than a billion people, some of these rivers (e.g., the Ganga-Brahmaputra, the Yangtze, the Nile and the Mekong) are the economic engines of the countries they transect, yet thorough assessment of their flow dynamics and variability in regard to water resource management is still lacking.

To this end, understanding the inter-annual and intra-seasonal variability and the spatial variability of the water balance components in the major river basins of the world will help to plan for improved management of water resources for the future.},

Bank retreat rates were monitored with erosion pins over a 2.25 year period. Concurrent detailed data were also obtained on river flow levels and ambient air and stream temperatures. Unique data on river bank thermal regimes are presented, along with rare information on the morphological properties and sediment yield characteristics of needle ice growths. Needle ice occurred even with mild freezing temperatures if sufficient bank moisture was present, with average growth rates of approximately 1 mm h-1. Bank material incorporation and mobilization within needle ice was significant: sediment yields of up to 4.02 kg m-2of bank face were observed, and represented between 32\% and 43\% of total bank erosion recorded. Most sediment was incorporated within needle ice when growth became stressed (because of overrapid cooling and/or limited moisture supplies), which supports the models of Outcalt and Fukuda. Four mechanisms of direct needle ice sediment transport on river banks were identified: direct particle fall, sediment-laden rivulets, sliding failures, and toppling failures. However, the indirect, preparatory role of needle ice and frost disturbance of bank surfaces is also emphasized, and the enhanced fluvial erosion which takes place when bank materials have first been conditioned by frost-related processes is noted. Both indirect and direct effects are expressed in a simple conceptual model and a number of the important system linkages examined. Combinations of needle ice action and subsequent fluid entrainment of weakened bank material appear to be the dominant mechanism for bank erosion here. Pronounced and persistent erosional notches in the lower parts of the bank profile were observed, showing that, in winter, even single, low-magnitude, flow events can effect significant channel width adjustment here. \textcopyright{} 1993.},

This paper discusses the application of the new Photo-Electronic Erosion Pin (PEEP) system to the quasi-continuous monitoring of river bank erosion and deposition events and their temporal variability. The PEEP system quantifies the erosional and depositional work of each, individual, flow and meteorological event, and defines a more complete picture of variability than is normally available with conventional methodologies. At least 60 erosion/deposition events were detected over the 16-month study period (33 erosion; 27 deposition), revealing a hitherto unsuspected level of dynamism for a river bank site. Five types of variability were also identified: complex response, nonlinearities in the flow-erosion relationship, hysteresis in the stage vs. bank-change relationship (hitherto unobserved), oscillatory effects, and flowindependent behaviour. The type, magnitude, direction and variability of bank response was related to both flow magnitude and bank preconditioning processes. The effective role of combinations of weathering processes and subsequent fluvial removal is stressed. A simple sediment balance for the lower bank suggests it is in quasi-equilibrium.},

We find that simulated western Arctic land warming trends during rapid sea ice loss are 3.5 times greater than secular 21st century climate-change trends. The accelerated warming signal penetrates up to 1500 km inland and is apparent throughout most of the year, peaking in autumn. Idealized experiments using the Community Land Model, with improved permafrost dynamics, indicate that an accelerated warming period substantially increases ground heat accumulation. Enhanced heat accumulation leads to rapid degradation of warm permafrost and may increase the vulnerability of colder permafrost to degradation under continued warming. Taken together, these results imply a link between rapid sea ice loss and permafrost health.},

  abstract = {The sensitivity of a global land-surface model projection of near-surface permafrost degradation is assessed with respect to explicit accounting of the thermal and hydrologic properties of soil organic matter and to a deepening of the soil column from 3.5 to 50 or more m. Together these modifications result in substantial improvements in the simulation of near-surface soil temperature in the Community Land Model (CLM). When forced off-line with archived data from a fully coupled Community Climate System Model (CCSM3) simulation of 20th century climate, the revised version of CLM produces a near-surface permafrost extent of 10.7 {$\surd$}\'E,\"A\^i 106 km2 (north of 45{$\surd$}\c{C}{$\lnot\infty$}N). This extent represents an improvement over the 8.5 {$\surd$}\'E,\"A\^i 106 km2 simulated in the standard model and compares reasonably with observed estimates for continuous and discontinuous permafrost area (11.2{$\surd\cent$},\c{C}\textasciidieresis,\"A\'u13.5 {$\surd$}\'E,\"A\^i 106 km2). The total extent in the new model remains lower than observed because of biases in CCSM3 air temperature and/or snow depth. The rate of near-surface permafrost degradation, in response to strong simulated Arctic warming ({$\surd\cent$}\`A\"U{$\lnot$}\textordmasculine{} +7.5{$\surd$}\c{C}{$\lnot\infty$}C over Arctic land from 1900 to 2100, A1B greenhouse gas emissions scenario), is slower inthe improved version of CLM, particularly during the early 21st century (81,000 versus 111,000 km2 a{$\surd\cent$}\`A\"U,\"A\^o1, where a is years). Even at the depressed rate, however, the warming is enough to drive near-surface permafrost extent sharply down by 2100. Experiments with a deep soil column exhibit a larger increase in ground heat flux than those without because of stronger near-surface vertical soil temperature gradients. This appears to lessen the sensitivity of soil temperature change to model soil depth.},

Implementing mitigation strategies requires an understanding and quantification of marine plastic sources, taking spatial and temporal variability into account. Here we present a global model of plastic inputs from rivers into oceans based on waste management, population density and hydrological information. Our model is calibrated against measurements available in the literature. We estimate that between 1.15 and 2.41 million tonnes of plastic waste currently enters the ocean every year from rivers, with over 74\% of emissions occurring between May and October. The top 20 polluting rivers, mostly located in Asia, account for 67\% of the global total. The findings of this study provide baseline data for ocean plastic mass balance exercises, and assist in prioritizing future plastic debris monitoring and mitigation strategies.},

Yet while countless hydrographic maps exist for well-known river basins and individual nations, there is a lack of seamless high-quality data on large scales such as continents or the entire globe. Data for many large international basins are patchy, and remote areas are often poorly mapped. In response to these limitations, a team of scientists has developed data and created maps of the world's rivers that provide the research community with more reliable information about where streams and watersheds occur on the Earth's surface and how water drains the landscape. The new product, known as HydroSHEDS (Hydrological Data and Maps Based on Shuttle Elevation Derivatives at Multiple Scales), provides this information at a resolution and quality unachieved by previous global data sets, such as HYDRO1k [U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), 2000].},

To enable advanced assessments of the role and effects of dams within the global river network and to support strategies for mitigating ecohydrological and socioeconomic costs, we introduce here the spatially explicit and hydrologically linked Global Reservoir and Dam database (GRanD). As of early 2011, GRanD contains information regarding 6862 dams and their associated reservoirs, with a total storage capacity of 6197 km3. On the basis of these records, we estimate that about 16.7 million reservoirs larger than 0.01 ha \textendash{} with a combined storage capacity of approximately 8070 km3 \textendash{} may exist worldwide, increasing Earth's terrestrial surface water area by more than 305 000 km2. We find that 575 900 river kilometers, or 7.6\% of the world's rivers with average flows above 1 cubic meter per second (m3 s-1), are affected by a cumulative upstream reservoir capacity that exceeds 2\% of their annual flow; the impact is highest for large rivers with average flows above 1000 m3 s-1, of which 46.7\% are affected. Finally, a sensitivity analysis suggests that smaller reservoirs have substantial impacts on the spatial extent of flow alterations despite their minor role in total reservoir capacity.},

In order to address these challenges, the scientific community needs to create improved large-scale datasets and more flexible data structures that enable the integration of information across and within spatial scales; develop new and advanced models that support the assessment of longitudinal and lateral hydrological connectivity; and provide an accessible modeling environment for researchers, decision makers, and practitioners. As a contribution, we here present a new modeling framework that integrates hydrographic baseline data at a global scale (enhanced HydroSHEDS layers and coupled datasets) with new modeling tools, specifically a river network routing model (HydroROUT) that is currently under development. The resulting `hydro-spatial fabric' is designed to provide an avenue for advanced hydro-ecological applications at large scales in a consistent and highly versatile way. Preliminary results from case studies to assess human impacts on water quality and the effects of dams on river fragmentation and downstream flow regulation illustrate the potential of this combined data-and-modeling framework to conduct novel research in the fields of aquatic ecology, biogeochemistry, geo-statistical modeling, or pollution and health risk assessments. The global scale outcomes are at a previously unachieved spatial resolution of 500 m and can thus support local planning and decision making in many of the world's large river basins.

  abstract = {In some coastal regions of the Arctic Ocean, grounded ice ridges contribute to stabilizing and maintaining a landfast ice cover. Recently, a grounding scheme representing this effect on sea ice dynamics was introduced and tested in a viscous-plastic sea ice model. This grounding scheme, based on a basal stress parameterization, improves the simulation of landfast ice in many regions such as in the East Siberian Sea, the Laptev Sea, and along the coast of Alaska. Nevertheless, in some regions like the Kara Sea, the area of landfast ice is systematically underestimated. This indicates that another mechanism such as ice arching is at play for maintaining the ice cover fast. To address this problem, the combination of the basal stress parameterization and tensile strength is investigated using a 0.25\textdegree{} Pan-Arctic CICE-NEMO configuration. Both uniaxial and isotropic tensile strengths notably improve the simulation of landfast ice in the Kara Sea but also in the Laptev Sea. However, the simulated landfast ice season for the Kara Sea is too short compared to observations. This is especially obvious for the onset of the landfast ice season which systematically occurs later in the model and with a slower build up. This suggests that improvements to the sea ice thermodynamics could reduce these discrepancies with the data.},

Preferred long-axis orientations in both zones vary in relation to valley geometry and ground ice distribution: differential insolation plays no direct role in detachment failure distribution. Rates of geomorphic work over periods of one to two centuries are of the same order of magnitude. Threshold meteorological conditions for initiating failures on the Fosheim Peninsula can be incorporated into a surface heating index, but pre-conditioning of the active layer remains important because rapid thaw does not always initiate activity. Slope pre-conditioning does not occur at the fire-affected sites because the failure zone is within formerly perennially frozen ground. Long-term rates of unit vertical transport at the most active site on the Fosheim Peninsula are similar to those due to debris flow and slushflow in a nearby mountain range. The frequency of potential triggering events at the Ellesmere Island sites is expected to increase if summer climate warms, providing low percentage cloud cover is maintained during periods of high air temperatures.

  abstract = {Fluvial bank erosion rates are often quantified by assuming that the erosion rate is a function of the excess (above a critical threshold) boundary shear stress applied by the flow. Research has shown that the form roughness induced by natural topographic bank features, such as slumps, spurs and embayments, is the dominant component of the spatially-averaged total shear stress, meaning that form roughness provides an important control on bank erosion rates. However, measuring the relative components of the total shear stress for a natural system is not straightforward. In this work we use the method of Kean and Smith to partition the form and skin drag components of river bank roughness using a time series (2005\textendash 2011) of high-resolution topographic surveys of an eroding bank of the Cecina River in central Italy. This method approximates the form drag component of the roughness along a longitudinal bank profile as a series of user-defined Gaussian curves. The extracted metrics are used in conjunction with an estimate of the outer region flow velocity to partition the form and skin drag components of the total boundary shear stress according to the Kean and Smith analytical solution. The relative magnitude of the form and skin shear stress at each survey date is analysed alongside DEMs of difference to reveal that intense episodes of erosion are followed by periods of quiescence. We show that this is due to the protection offered by increased form drag roughness following erosion. We conceptualise the dynamic feedbacks that exist between river discharge, bank erosion processes and bank form roughness, into a simple model of the self-limiting nature of river bank erosion.},

  abstract = {A new physically based runoff routing model, called the Model for Scale Adaptive River Transport (MOSART), has been developed to be applicable across local, regional, and global scales. Within each spatial unit, surface runoff is first routed across hillslopes and then discharged along with subsurface runoff into a ``tributary subnetwork'' before entering the main channel. The spatial units are thus linked via routing through the main channel network, which is constructed in a scale-consistent way across different spatial resolutions. All model parameters are physically based, and only a small subset requires calibration. MOSART has been applied to the Columbia River basin at {$\frac{1}{6}^\circ$}, {$\frac{1}{8}^\circ$}, {$\frac{1}{4}^\circ$}, and {$\frac{1}{2}^\circ$} spatial resolutions and was evaluated using naturalized or observed streamflow at a number of gauge stations. MOSART is compared to two other routing models widely used with land surface models, the River Transport Model (RTM) in the Community Land Model (CLM) and the Lohmann routing model, included as a postprocessor in the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model package, yielding consistent performance at multiple resolutions. MOSART is further evaluated using the channel velocities derived from field measurements or a hydraulic model at various locations and is shown to be capable of producing the seasonal variation and magnitude of channel velocities reasonably well at different resolutions. Moreover, the impacts of spatial resolution on model simulations are systematically examined at local and regional scales. Finally, the limitations of MOSART and future directions for improvements are discussed.},

  abstract = {A meandering channel has developed in the middle Tarim River, the longest inland river flowing through a hyperarid environment in northwestern China. Although the drainage basin of the Tarim River extends over 1 million km2, flow in downstream reaches is largely restricted to summer months, and irrigation pressures have made the flood season increasingly short. The planform morphology, lateral migration rate, and cutoffs of 105 meanders were analysed using multiperiod remote sensing images and field survey analyses of channel bed and bank properties and of riparian vegetation cover. Results show that planform attributes of the meandering Tarim River are similar to those found in other environments. The ratio of the channel centreline length to the neck channel width of meanders ranges between 1.2 and 8.1, the bend curvature (ratio of bend radius to channel width) ranges between 0.30 and 2.8, and the average deflection angle of the bend apexes is 79.9\textdegree. Meander migration rates range from 1.4 to 96.7 m y- 1. From 2000 to 2013, 45 cutoffs occurred along the 400-km-long reach. As the riparian vegetation cover is sparse because of limited precipitation and because banks are comprised of dense roots, fine sand and silt materials, but lack clay, bank strength is limited and presents limited constraints upon bend movement.},

An estimate of the entrainment buoyancy flux scaling is made to best fit the LES results. The presence of Stokes drift forcing and the resulting Langmuir turbulence enhances the entrainment rate significantly under weak surface destabilizing buoyancy flux conditions, that is, weakly convective turbulence. In contrast, Langmuir turbulence effects are moderate when convective turbulence is dominant and appear to be additive rather than multiplicative to the convection-induced mixing. The parameterized unresolved velocity scale in the K-profile parameterization (KPP) is modified to adhere to the new scaling law of the entrainment buoyancy flux and account for the effects of Langmuir turbulence. This modification is targeted on common situations in a climate model where either Langmuir turbulence or convection is important and may overestimate the entrainment when both are weak. Nevertheless, the modified KPP is tested in a global climate model and generally outperforms those tested in previous studies. Improvements in the simulated mixed layer depth are found, especially in the Southern Ocean in austral summer.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a theoretical investigation of the effects of spatial heterogeneity of runoff generation on the scaling behavior of runoff timing responses. A previous modeling study on the Illinois River Basin in Oklahoma had revealed a systematic spatial trend in the relative dominance of different runoff generation mechanisms, attributable to corresponding systematic trends in landscape properties. Considering the differences in the timing of hillslope responses between the different runoff mechanisms, this paper explores their impacts on the catchment-scale runoff routing responses, including how they change with spatial scale. For this purpose we utilize a distributed, physically based hydrological model, with a fully hydraulic stream network routing component. The model is used to generate instantaneous response functions (IRF) for nested catchments of a range of sizes along the river network and quantitative measures of their shape, e.g., peak and time to peak. In order to separate the effects of soil heterogeneity from those due to basin geomorphology, the model simulations are carried out for three hypothetical cases that make assumptions regarding landscape properties (uniform, a systematic trend, and heterogeneity plus the trend), repeating these simulations under wet and dry antecedent conditions. The simulations produced expected and also surprising results. The power law relationship between the peak of the IRF and drainage area is shown to be flatter under wet conditions than under dry conditions, even though the (faster) saturation excess mechanism is more dominant under wet conditions. This result appears to be caused by partial area runoff generation: under wet conditions, the fraction of saturation area is about 30\%, while under dry conditions it is less than 10\% for the same input of rainfall. This means travel times associated with overland flow (which mostly contributes to the peak and time to peak) are, in fact, longer during wet conditions than during dry conditions. The power law relationship between peak and drainage area also exhibits a scaling break at around 1000 km2, which can be shown to be related to the peculiar geomorphology of the catchment.},

The entire route lies in Arctic waters, which due to global warming, has become ice free during summer and autumn. The route goes from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean along the Russian Arctic coast and reduces voyage distance by 40\% between Northern Europe and Japan. Traditionally, comparisons of the climate impact of transport solutions have been based on fuel consumption and carbon dioxide (CO2), while other trace emissions in the exhaust gas have been ignored. It is becoming increasingly well-known however, that aerosols, and their precursors emitted from shipping are strong climate forcers, with a magnitude that is intimately connected to the specific region of emission. Taking into account these considerations, we apply region-specific Global Warming Potential (GWP) characterization factors to estimate the relative magnitude of the short-lived climate forcers in the Arctic compared to traditional shipping regions and to the impact of CO2 emissions in light of reduced overall fuel consumption. The results indicate that there are no general climate benefits of utilizing the Northern Sea Route, even with cleaner fuels, since the additional impact of emissions in the Arctic more than offsets the effect of shorter voyages. In terms of climate change mitigation, managing this trade-off will be challenging, as the Northern Sea Route offers cost savings per ton of freight transported.},

Observations are particularly sparse, in both time and space, in the polar regions. Hence, modeling systems have been widely used and are a powerful tool to gain understanding on the functioning of the Arctic freshwater system and its integration within the global Earth system and climate. Here we present a review of modeling studies addressing some aspect of the Arctic freshwater system. Through illustrative examples, we point out the value of using a hierarchy of models with increasing complexity and component interactions, in order to dismantle the important processes at play for the variability and changes of the different components of the Arctic freshwater system and the interplay between them. We discuss past and projected changes for the Arctic freshwater system and explore the sources of uncertainty associated with these model results. We further elaborate on some missing processes that should be included in future generations of Earth system models and highlight the importance of better quantification and understanding of natural variability, among other factors, for improved predictions of Arctic freshwater system change.},

  abstract = {This study systematically analyzes long-term (1950,\"A\`i1992) stream temperature records for the major sub-basins within the Lena River watershed in order to describe water temperature regimes over the various parts of the Lena watershed and document significant stream temperature changes induced by reservoir regulation, and by natural variations/changes. The results show that the open water season can be divided into three consecutive stages,\"A\^i,\"A\'uincreasing temperature stage,\"A\`u in the early open water season, ,\"A\'ustable temperature stage,\"A\`u in the mid-warm season, and ,\"A\'udecreasing temperature stage,\"A\`u in the late open water season. Temperature conditions are similar over the Aldan and Upper Lena regions. However, stream temperatures at the Lena basin outlet are up to 8 {$\lnot\infty$}C lower than those over the southern sub-basins. This suggests that the latitudinal difference in climatic variables, such as air temperature, might be the major control on stream temperature regime. Results also demonstrate that the reservoir regulation has a strong influence on the regional water temperature regime and change in the regulated sub-basin. Reservoir regulation has increased (decreased) the downstream water temperatures in the Vilui valley during the early (mid) open water season. Trend analyses show consistent warming trends across the entire Lena River basin in the early open water season. This may indicate a response to earlier snowmelt over the Lena River watershed. Trend results also demonstrate that the Aldan tributary, without much human impact, experiences warming (cooling) trends in the first (second) half of the open water season, leading to a stream temperature regime shift toward early open water season. The upper Lena River has warming (cooling) trends in the early (mid-late) open water season. Over the regulated Vilui tributary, however, stream temperatures have significantly increased in the early and late parts of the warm season due to combined effects of natural changes and reservoir regulation. Over the Lena basin as a whole, strong positive correlations have been found between the basin mean monthly air and water temperatures during the warm season. Increasing water temperatures were observed during the early and mid-June. Because of stream temperature increase in this peak flow period, the Lena River heat flux has gone up by 23\% in June. This may have considerable impact on the thermal conditions of the Laptev Sea in the early summer season.},

Yet scholars rarely consider the way these associations may present barriers to, or facilitate, effective translation of scientific data into broadly available information for stakeholders to create and debate policy. In light of rapidly changing arctic environments how can data best be collected and disseminated to affected stakeholders as usable information to facilitate effective planning? This article explores the linkages between scientific data production and policy implementation related to sea ice loss in the Arctic. The rapid decline of arctic summer sea ice is currently tracked and studied intensively but a comprehensive approach to address the changes is lacking. Our work builds upon earlier research establishing the need to approach sea ice as a complex multi-jurisdictional geophysical\textendash social\textendash ecological feature from a services standpoint. Our research catalogs the geography of sea ice institutions in northern Alaska to demonstrate the fragmentation in data production and distribution. We then examine two case studies. The first is a newly established cross-scale information bridge improving sea-ice and weather information relevant to walrus hunting and management. The second is the case of the emerging arctic marine traffic regime. We argue that in order to maximize data production, dissemination, and participatory capacity across stakeholders: (1) scientific observations should be tied to institutional density and sea ice services, and (2) information bridges should exist across major institutional actors.},

Despite this, little is known about the seasonal and geographic variability of riverine chemistry throughout much of the Canadian north. Here we assess the chemical composition of a broad suite of rivers draining to the Canadian Arctic Ocean and Hudson Bay using previously unpublished government data. We focus on inorganic and organic carbon (alkalinity and dissolved organic carbon), using paired chemistry and discharge measurements to assess constituent flux. Concentrations and area-normalized yields vary substantially across the northern Canadian landscape, with dissolved organic carbon typically highest in rivers draining the Hudson Bay Lowland, alkalinity highest in rivers draining Cordillera and Plains terrains, and the ratio of organic to inorganic species highest in rivers draining the Canadian Shield. Yields of major weathering ions show that carbonate weathering\textemdash a notable proportion of which may be driven by sulfide oxidation\textemdash dominates inorganic carbon delivery from the rivers we assess. Despite the reasonably diverse coverage of the data set, we find that clear gaps exist, including a lack of data through to the present day for many rivers, and a dearth of measurements from the Arctic Archipelago and eastern shores of Hudson Bay. We therefore use a modeling approach to extrapolate fluxes to the full Canadian Arctic drainage basin. Region-specific differences between our results and previous models reinforce the need for targeted river water chemistry measures throughout the Canadian Arctic domain.},

The systematic representation of models in steps, or hierarchies, connects our understanding from idealized systems to comprehensive models, and ultimately the observed atmosphere. We define three interconnected principles that can be used to characterize the model hierarchies of the atmosphere. We explore the rich diversity within the governing equations in the dynamical hierarchy, the ability to isolate and understand atmospheric processes in the process hierarchy, and the importance of the physical domain and resolution in the hierarchy of scale. We center our discussion on the large scale circulation of the atmosphere and its interaction with clouds and convection, focusing on areas where simple models have had a significant impact. Our confidence in climate model projections of the future is based on our efforts to ground the climate predictions in fundamental physical understanding. This understanding is, in part, possible due to the hierarchies of idealized models that afford the simplicity required for understanding complex systems.},

  abstract = {Through analysis of over 2500 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) scenes spanning the period 1996\textendash 2008, we have compiled the most comprehensive dataset to date on landfast sea ice extent and its annual cycle in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas. Our results show that landfast ice in the central and western Beaufort Sea forms earlier, breaks up later, occupies deeper water and extends further from shore than that in the Chukchi Sea. The differences in the timing of the annual landfast ice cycle are largely due to regional contrasts in the southward advance of pack ice in early winter and the onset of spring thaw. On the other hand, we suggest that the differences in landfast ice extent between the two seas are related to the number and distribution of recurring grounded ice features. These grounded features appear as ``nodes'' where the seaward landfast ice edge (SLIE) persistently recurs in multiple years. In the Beaufort Sea there are several such nodes that occur in water depths around 20m, giving rise to the similarity between the average SLIE location and the 20m isobath. We attribute the narrower landfast ice in the Chukchi Sea and lack of a consistent relationship with bathymetry to the sparsity of nodes in the Chukchi Sea. In comparing our results with data from the period 1973\textendash 76, we find that landfast ice extent in the Beaufort Sea has not changed significantly in the last four decades. However, in the Chukchi Sea our results show the landfast ice width has decreased by a coast-wide average of 13km over this period. We again attribute this difference between the two seas to the distribution of recurring grounded ice features. Over the 12 annual cycles in the study period, we identify trends indicating that landfast ice is forming later and disappearing earlier by approximately one week per decade. Although these trends are not statistically significant, they are in agreement with an overall shortening of the landfast ice season by as much as two months over the past three decades, revealed by a comparison with earlier findings for the period 1973\textendash 77.},

  abstract = {The Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) mission used laser altimetry measurements to determine changes in elevations of glaciers and ice sheets, as well as sea ice thickness distribution. These measurements have provided important information on the response of the cryopshere (Earth's frozen surfaces) to changes in atmosphere and ocean condition. ICESat operated from 2003 to 2009 and provided repeat altimetry measurements not only to the cryosphere scientific community but also to the ocean, terrestrial and atmospheric scientific communities. The conclusive assessment of significant ongoing rapid changes in the Earth's ice cover, in part supported by ICESat observations, has strengthened the need for sustained, high accuracy, repeat observations similar to what was provided by the ICESat mission. Following recommendations from the National Research Council for an ICESat follow-on mission, the ICESat-2 mission is now under development for planned launch in 2018. The primary scientific aims of the ICESat-2 mission are to continue measurements of sea ice freeboard and ice sheet elevation to determine their changes at scales from outlet glaciers to the entire ice sheet, and from 10s of meters to the entire polar oceans for sea ice freeboard. ICESat carried a single beam profiling laser altimeter that produced \textasciitilde 70m diameter footprints on the surface of the Earth at \textasciitilde 150m along-track intervals. In contrast, ICESat-2 will operate with three pairs of beams, each pair separated by about 3km cross-track with a pair spacing of 90m. Each of the beams will have a nominal 17m diameter footprint with an along-track sampling interval of 0.7m. The differences in the ICESat-2 measurement concept are a result of overcoming some limitations associated with the approach used in the ICESat mission. The beam pair configuration of ICESat-2 allows for the determination of local cross-track slope, a significant factor in measuring elevation change for the outlet glaciers surrounding the Greenland and Antarctica coasts. The multiple beam pairs also provide improved spatial coverage. The dense spatial sampling eliminates along-track measurement gaps, and the small footprint diameter is especially useful for sea surface height measurements in the often narrow leads needed for sea ice freeboard and ice thickness retrievals. The ICESat-2 instrumentation concept uses a low energy 532nm (green) laser in conjunction with single-photon sensitive detectors to measure range. Combining ICESat-2 data with altimetry data collected since the start of the ICESat mission in 2003, such as Operation IceBridge and ESA's CryoSat-2, will yield a 15+ year record of changes in ice sheet elevation and sea ice thickness. ICESat-2 will also provide information of mountain glacier and ice cap elevations changes, land and vegetation heights, inland water elevations, sea surface heights, and cloud layering and optical thickness.},

At present a method to describe a channel network pattern and changes in the network beyond the simplistic braiding index is unavailable.

The Jamuna River was taken as an example with a series of Landsat TM and ETM+ images taken at irregular intervals between 1999 and 2004.

Temporally, relatively few channels changed dramatically in both low-flow and high-flow periods despite the increase of braiding index during a flood. Based on the centrality we calculated a weighted braiding index that represents the number of important channels in the network, which is about two in the Jamuna River and which is larger immediately after floods.

We are able to estimate flow direction, along-channel distance, channel width, and network-related metrics for deltaic analyses including the steady-state fluxes. To demonstrate the capabilities of the toolkit, we apply our software to the Wax Lake and Atchafalaya River Deltas using water masks derived from Open Street Map (OSM) and Google Maps. We validate our width estimates using the Global River Width from Landsat (GRWL) database over the Mackenzie Delta as well as in situ width measurements from the National Water Information System (NWIS) in the southeastern United States. We also compare the stream flow direction estimates using products from RivGraph, a related Python package with similar functionality. With the exciting opportunities afforded with forthcoming surface water and topography (SWOT) data, we envision Orinoco as a tool to support the characterization of the complex structure of river deltas worldwide and to make such analyses easily accessible within a Python remote sensing workflow. To support that end, all the data, analyses, and figures in this paper can be found within Jupyter notebooks at Orinoco\&rsquo;s GitHub repository.},

  abstract = {The Arctic sea ice cover is thinning and retreating, causing changes in surface roughness that in turn modify the momentum flux from the atmosphere through the ice into the ocean. New model simulations comprising variable sea ice drag coefficients for both the air and water interface demonstrate that the heterogeneity in sea ice surface roughness significantly impacts the spatial distribution and trends of ocean surface stress during the last decades. Simulations with constant sea ice drag coefficients as used in most climate models show an increase in annual mean ocean surface stress (0.003 N/m2 per decade, 4.6\%) due to the reduction of ice thickness leading to a weakening of the ice and accelerated ice drift. In contrast, with variable drag coefficients our simulations show annual mean ocean surface stress is declining at a rate of -0.002 N/m2 per decade (3.1\%) over the period 1980\textendash 2013 because of a significant reduction in surface roughness associated with an increasingly thinner and younger sea ice cover. The effectiveness of sea ice in transferring momentum does not only depend on its resistive strength against the wind forcing but is also set by its top and bottom surface roughness varying with ice types and ice conditions. This reveals the need to account for sea ice surface roughness variations in climate simulations in order to correctly represent the implications of sea ice loss under global warming.},

  abstract = {Large freshwater contributions to the Arctic Ocean from a variety of sources combine in what is, by global standards, a remarkably small ocean basin. Indeed, the Arctic Ocean receives {$\sim$}11\% of global river discharge while accounting for only {$\sim$}1\% of global ocean volume. As a consequence, estuarine gradients are a defining feature not only near-shore, but throughout the Arctic Ocean. Sea-ice dynamics also play a pivotal role in the salinity regime, adding salt to the underlying water during ice formation and releasing fresh water during ice thaw. Our understanding of physical\textendash chemical\textendash biological interactions within this complex system is rapidly advancing. However, much of the estuarine research to date has focused on summer, open water conditions. Furthermore, our current conceptual model for Arctic estuaries is primarily based on studies of a few major river inflows. Future advancement of estuarine research in the Arctic requires concerted seasonal coverage as well as a commitment to working within a broader range of systems. With clear signals of climate change occurring in the Arctic and greater changes anticipated in the future, there is good reason to accelerate estuarine research efforts in the region. In particular, elucidating estuarine dynamics across the near-shore to ocean-wide domains is vital for understanding potential climate impacts on local ecosystems as well as broader climate feedbacks associated with storage and release of fresh water and carbon.},

In non-Arctic regions, storm flow is commonly dominated by old water, that is, water that existed in the basin before the storm. We suspected that this may not be true in Arctic regions where permafrost diminishes subsurface storage capacity. Streamflow during the snowmelt period was nearly all new water. However, all summer storms were dominated by old water. Storms in a neighboring basin were dominated by new water but much less than was the snowmelt event. Thus a large increase in old water contributions occurred following the snowmelt period. This increase continued moderately through the summer in 1994 but not in 1995. We credit the seasonal changes in old water contributions to increased subsurface storage capacity due to thawing of the active layer.},

  abstract = {Sea ice in the Arctic is one of the most rapidly changing components of the global climate system. Over the past few decades, summer areal extent has declined over 30\%, and all months show statistically significant declining trends. New satellite missions and techniques have greatly expanded information on sea ice thickness, but many uncertainties remain in the satellite data and long-term records are sparse. However, thickness observations and other satellite-derived data indicate a 40\% decline in thickness, due in large part to the loss of thicker, older ice cover. The changes in sea ice are happening faster than models have projected. With continued increasing temperatures, summer ice-free conditions are likely sometime in the coming decades, though there are substantial uncertainties in the exact timing and high interannual variability will remain as sea ice decreases. The changes in Arctic sea ice are already having an impact on flora and fauna in the Arctic. Some species will face increasing challenges in the future, while new habitat will open up for other species. The changes are also affecting people living and working in the Arctic. Native communities are facing challenges to their traditional ways of life, while new opportunities open for shipping, fishing, and natural resource extraction. Significant progress has been made in recent years in understanding of Arctic sea ice and its role in climate, the ecosystem, and human activities. However, significant challenges remain in furthering the knowledge of the processes, impacts, and future evolution of the system.},

By midcentury for standard open water vessels, the frequency of navigable periods doubles, with routes across the central Arctic becoming available. A sea ice-ship speed relationship is used to show that European routes to Asia typically become 10 days faster via the Arctic than alternatives by midcentury, and 13 days faster by late century, while North American routes become 4 days faster. Future greenhouse gas emissions have a larger impact by late century; the shipping season reaching 4\textendash 8 months in Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)8.5 double that of RCP2.6, both with substantial interannual variability. Moderately, ice-strengthened vessels likely enable Arctic transits for 10\textendash 12 months by late century.},

We quantified the economic impacts of climate change on Alaska public infrastructure under relatively high and low climate forcing scenarios [representative concentration pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) and RCP4.5] using an infrastructure model modified to account for unique climate impacts at northern latitudes, including near-surface permafrost thaw. Additionally, we evaluated how proactive adaptation influenced economic impacts on select infrastructure types and developed first-order estimates of potential land losses associated with coastal erosion and lengthening of the coastal ice-free season for 12 communities. Cumulative estimated expenses from climate-related damage to infrastructure without adaptation measures (hereafter damages) from 2015 to 2099 totaled \$5.5 billion (2015 dollars, 3\% discount) for RCP8.5 and \$4.2 billion for RCP4.5, suggesting that reducing greenhouse gas emissions could lessen damages by \$1.3 billion this century. The distribution of damages varied across the state, with the largest damages projected for the interior and southcentral Alaska. The largest source of damages was road flooding caused by increased precipitation followed by damages to buildings associated with near-surface permafrost thaw. Smaller damages were observed for airports, railroads, and pipelines. Proactive adaptation reduced total projected cumulative expenditures to \$2.9 billion for RCP8.5 and \$2.3 billion for RCP4.5. For road flooding, adaptation provided an annual savings of 80\textendash 100\% across four study eras. For nearly all infrastructure types and time periods evaluated, damages and adaptation costs were larger for RCP8.5 than RCP4.5. Estimated coastal erosion losses were also larger for RCP8.5.},

  abstract = {In this paper we analyze the controls on the spatiotemporal variability of event runoff coefficients. A total of about 64,000 events in 459 Austrian catchments ranging from 5 to 10000 km2 are analyzed. Event runoff coefficients vary in space, depending on the long-term controls such as climate and catchment formation. Event runoff coefficients also vary in time, depending on event characteristics such as antecedent soil moisture and event rainfall depth. Both types of controls are analyzed separately in the paper. The spatial variability is analyzed in terms of a correlation analysis of the statistical moments of the runoff coefficients and catchment attributes. Mean runoff coefficients are most strongly correlated to indicators representing climate such as mean annual precipitation and the long-term ratio of actual evaporation to precipitation through affecting long-term soil moisture. Land use, soil types, and geology do not seem to exert a major control on runoff coefficients of the catchments under study. The temporal variability is analyzed by comparing the deviation of the event runoff coefficients from their mean depending on event characteristics. The analysis indicates that antecedent soil moisture conditions control runoff coefficients to a higher degree than does event rainfall. The analysis also indicates that soil moisture derived from soil moisture accounting schemes has more predictive power for the temporal variability of runoff coefficients than antecedent rainfall.},

  abstract = {Health warning Nature this week includes reviews, original research and comment on a hot topic, the regional effects of climate change. The cover image \textemdash{} Chicago during the July 1995 heatwave \textemdash{} highlights one potential risk. Patz et al. consider the available evidence and suggest that climate warming already contributes to ill health and thousands of premature deaths across the world, and is likely to have serious health implications in the future. Recent work suggests that some regions are particularly at risk: areas where climate is dominated by El Ni\~no/Southern Oscillation events, sub-Saharan Africa, and sprawling urban areas subject to the heat island effect are already suffering from climate impacts and these are projected to increase. In many cases, regions at high risk are those least responsible for causing climate change.Sure thing All currently available climate models predict a near-surface warming trend under the influence of rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Barnett et al. evaluate the effect of such a warming trend on regional hydrology, particularly in snowmelt-dominated environments. They suggest that warming will cause a change from snowfall to rain, diminishing natural water storage capacity, as well as earlier melting of winter snow, shifting peak river runoff away from the periods of highest demand in summer and autumn. The reduction in glaciers and snow-packs are likely to have severe consequences for the water supply of one-sixth of the Earth's population.Water supply It is generally assumed that climate change will alter the hydrological cycle, but predicting which parts of the world will be drier and which will be wetter is a difficult problem. Milly et al. focus on streamflow and water availability trends and find that an ensemble of twelve current climate models accurately accounts for twentieth-century changes. The same models project potentially crucial regional effects on streamflow in the future that could threaten the availability of freshwater in many regions of the world by the year 2050.},

Interpretation of these diagnostics requires detailed knowledge of the radiative, chemical, dynamical, and physical processes incorporated in the models. Also an understanding of the degree to which CCMI-1 recommendations for simulations have been followed is necessary to understand model responses to anthropogenic and natural forcing and also to explain intermodel differences. This becomes even more important given the ongoing development and the ever-growing complexity of these models.

  abstract = {Natural variability in water flow is an inherent feature of river ecosystems, but many rivers in the world have been dammed, altering the flow regime and leading to ecosystem degradation. Dam reoperation to maintain environmental flows has been proposed for ecosystem and biodiversity improvement. Reoperation requires an understanding of flow alteration due to dam operations. However, knowledge of natural flow regimes and their degree of alteration remain poor in Japan. The Japanese islands extend from the sub-Arctic to the subtropics with four seasons and thus are considered to show high spatial and temporal variation in flow regime and alterations caused by those variations. We examined the spatial and temporal dependency of flow alteration by flood-control dams in Japan. We confirmed that flood-control dams reduced the rate of change in discharge and peak discharge and that such dams fulfilled their primary role of preventing flood disaster by reducing and delaying flooding. However, other flow characteristics, such as high- and low-flow frequency and duration, were also altered. We demonstrated that the magnitude, frequency, duration, and seasonality of high and low flows in undammed flow regimes differed with latitude and that discharge alteration was spatially and temporally dependent, presumably because dam operation responded to the inherent differences in seasonal flow variability at different latitudes.},

  abstract = {Freshening in the Canada basin of the Arctic Ocean began in the 1990s1,2 and continued3 to at least the end of 2008. By then, the Arctic Ocean might have gained four times as much fresh water as comprised the Great Salinity Anomaly4,5of the 1970s, raising the spectre of slowing global ocean circulation6. Freshening has been attributed to increased sea ice melting1 and contributions from runoff7, but a leading explanation has been a strengthening of the Beaufort High\textemdash a characteristic peak in sea level atmospheric pressure2,8\textemdash which tends to accelerate an anticyclonic (clockwise) wind pattern causing convergence of fresh surface water. Limited observations have made this explanation difficult to verify, and observations of increasing freshwater content under a weakened Beaufort High suggest that other factors2 must be affecting freshwater content. Here we use observations to show that during a time of record reductions in ice extent from 2005 to 2008, the dominant freshwater content changes were an increase in the Canada basin balanced by a decrease in the Eurasian basin. Observations are drawn from satellite data (sea surface height and ocean-bottom pressure) and in situ data. The freshwater changes were due to a cyclonic (anticlockwise) shift in the ocean pathway of Eurasian runoff forced by strengthening of the west-to-east Northern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation characterized by an increased Arctic Oscillation9 index. Our results confirm that runoff is an important influence on the Arctic Ocean and establish that the spatial and temporal manifestations of the runoff pathways are modulated by the Arctic Oscillation, rather than the strength of the wind-driven Beaufort Gyre circulation.},

A simplified, axisymmetrical model of water flow, sediment transport, bank erosion and bank advance is used to study the first two mechanisms. Simulations using the model are compared with field data from a bank stabilization project along the Brahmaputra-Jamuna River in Bangladesh. The effects of bank stabilization are reproduced qualitatively but the quantitative results are poor. The model overestimates channel width while underestimating bank migration rate and outer-bend scour.},

  abstract = {The rate of migration, calculated by numerical models of river meandering, is commonly based on a method that relates the rate of migration to near-bank excess velocity multiplied by a dimensionless coefficient. Notwithstanding its simplicity, since the early 1980s this method has provided important insight into the long-term evolution of meander planforms through theoretical exercises. Its use in practice has not been as successful, because the complexity of the physical processes responsible for bank retreat, the heterogeneity in floodplain soils, and the presence of vegetation, make the calibration of the dimensionless coefficient rather challenging. This paper presents a new approach that calculates rates of meander migration using physically-based streambank erosion formulations. The University of Illinois RVR Meander model, which simulates meandering-river flow and bed morphodynamics, is integrated with algorithms for streambank erosion of the US Department of Agriculture channel evolution computer model CONCEPTS. The performance of the proposed approach is compared to that of the more simple classic method through the application to several test cases for idealized and natural planform geometry. The advantages and limitations of the approach are discussed, focusing on simulated planform pattern, the impact of soil spatial heterogeneity, the relative importance of the different processes controlling bank erosion (hydraulic erosion, cantilever, and planar failure), the requirements for obtaining stable migration patterns (centerline filtering and interpolation of bank physical properties), and the capability of predicting the planform evolution of natural rivers over engineering time scales (i.e., 50 to 100. years). The applications show that the improved physically-based method of bank retreat is required to capture the complex long-term migration patterns of natural channels, which cannot be merely predicted from hydrodynamics only. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier B.V..},

  abstract = {Past analytical studies of meander planform development have mostly focused on the complexity of the governing equations, i.e., hydrodynamics, and less so on the stream bank resistance to erosion, whose spatial heterogeneity is difficult to describe deterministically. This motivated the use of a Monte Carlo approach to examine the effects of floodplain soils and their distribution on planform development, with the goal of including bank erosion properties in the analysis. Simulated bank erosion rates are controlled by the resistance to hydraulic erosion of the bank soils using an excess shear stress approach. The spatial distribution of critical shear stress across the floodplain is delineated on a rectangular, equidistant grid with varying degrees of variability. The corresponding erodibility coefficient is computed using a field-derived empirical relation. For a randomly disturbed distribution, in which the mean resistance to erosion exponentially increases away from the valley centerline, two relevant parameters are identified: the standard deviation of the critical shear stress distribution, which controls skewness and variability of the channel centerline, and the cross-valley increase in soil resistance, which constrains lateral migration and also affects bend skewness. For a purely random distribution, migrated centerlines exhibit larger variability for increasing spatial scales of floodplain soil heterogeneity. For equal stochastic variability of the corresponding governing parameters, relating meander migration to hydraulic erosion of the bank soils produces more variability and shape complexity than the \&\#8220;classic\&\#8221; bank migration approach of Ikeda et al. (1981), which relates migration rate to excess velocity at the outer bank. Finally, the proposed stochastic approach provides a foundation for estimating a suitable spatial density of measurements to characterize the physical properties of floodplain soils and vegetation.},

As part of this, a project was undertaken to map the extent of surface water across Australia using the multi-decadal archive of Landsat satellite imagery. A water detection algorithm was used based on a decision tree classifier, and a comparison methodology using a logistic regression. This approach provided an understanding of the confidence in the water observations. The results were used to map the presence of surface water across the entire continent from every observation of 27years of satellite imagery. The Water Observation from Space (WOfS) product provides insight into the behaviour of surface water across Australia through time, demonstrating where water is persistent, such as in reservoirs, and where it is ephemeral, such as on floodplains during a flood. In addition the WOfS product is useful for studies of wetland extent, aquatic species behaviour, hydrological models, land surface process modelling and groundwater recharge. This paper describes the WOfS methodology and shows how similar time-series analyses of nationally significant environmental variables might be conducted at the continental scale.},

All of the large rivers that originated from Himalaya and flowing into the IGB plain (like Ganga, Ghagra, Ramganga, Rapti, Bagmati, Koshi, Teesta, Brahmaputra, etc.), shift their position vigorously and create massive kind of bank erosion. In the present study, we have selected 35.30 km alluvial reach of lower Ramganga river which is one of the major tributaries of the Ganga River. The study aims to quantify the amount and rate of bank erosion and accretion phenomena, also to find out the nature of bank erosion and accretion. In the present paper, we assessed the bank erosion and accretion of 91 years. We have taken 1923 toposheets, and Landsat images of 1972, 1981, 1993, 2003, and 2014 for the study. Demarcation of bank lines and estimation of bank erosion and accretion areas (for left and right bank separately) were done by using ArcGIS. Detailed field works were also done for investigating the nature of bank erosion and accretion as well as for bank line demarcation. The study reveals that in all of the evaluated periods, the river has experienced differential rates and amounts of bank erosion and accretion. The widening of channel, extension of meander bends along with lateral movements of the channel and chute cutoff are mainly responsible for bank erosion and accretion, while liquefaction and flowage of bank materials and shear failure were the principle mechanisms for that.},

Although local and basin-scale differences in riverine fish diversity have been analysed as functions of energy availability and habitat heterogeneity2, scale-dependent environmental conditions3 and river discharge4,5, a model that predicts a comprehensive set of system-wide diversity patterns has been hard to find. Here we show that fish diversity patterns throughout the Mississippi\textendash Missouri River System are well described by a neutral metacommunity model coupled with an appropriate habitat capacity distribution and dispersal kernel. River network structure acts as an effective template for characterizing spatial attributes of fish biodiversity. We show that estimates of average dispersal behaviour and habitat capacities, objectively calculated from average runoff production, yield reliable predictions of large-scale spatial biodiversity patterns in riverine systems. The success of the neutral theory in two-dimensional forest ecosystems6,7,8 and here in dendritic riverine ecosystems suggests the possible application of neutral metacommunity models in a diverse suite of ecosystems.

  abstract = {Modification of the land use of a small catchment through coniferous afforestation is shown to have influenced stream bank erosion and channel form. Field mapping and erosion pin measurements over a 19-month period provides evidence of more active bank erosion along forested channel reaches than along non-forested. Extrapolation of downstream increases in bankfull width, bankfull depth, and channel capacity with increasing basin area for the non-forested catchment has demonstrated that afforestation of the lower part of the catchment has had a marked effect on channel form. Channel widths within the forest are up to three times greater than that predicted from the regression. These changes in bankfull width have led to stream bed aggradation and the development of wide shallow channels within the forest, and channel capacities within the forest are over two times that predicted from the basin area. The relationship between channel sinuosity and valley gradient for non-forested reaches of the river also indicated decreased sinuosity resulting from afforestation. These changes in channel form result from active bank erosion within the forest with coarse material being deposited within the channel as point-bars and mid-channel bars. Active bank erosion is largely attributed to the suppression by the forest of a thick grass turf and its associated dense network of fine roots, and secondly to the river attempting to bypass log jams and debris dams in the stream channel.},

Currently there is a renewed interest in exploring the possibility of anopheline larval control through environmental management or larvicide as an additional means of reducing malaria transmission in Africa. This study examined the landscape determinants of anopheline mosquito larval habitats and usefulness of remote sensing in identifying these habitats in western Kenya highlands. Methods: Panchromatic aerial photos, Ikonos and Landsat Thematic Mapper 7 satellite images were acquired for a study area in Kakamega, western Kenya. Supervised classification of land-use and land-cover and visual identification of aquatic habitats were conducted. Ground survey of all aquatic habitats was conducted in the dry and rainy seasons in 2003. All habitats positive for anopheline larvae were identified. The retrieved data from the remote sensors were compared to the ground results on aquatic habitats and land-use. The probability of finding aquatic habitats and habitats with Anopheles larvae were modelled based on the digital elevation model and landuse types. Results: The misclassification rate of land-cover types was 10.8\% based on Ikonos imagery, 22.6\% for panchromatic aerial photos and 39.2\% for Landsat TM 7 imagery. The Ikonos image identified 40.6\% of aquatic habitats, aerial photos identified 10.6\%, and Landsate TM 7 image identified 0\%. Computer models based on topographic features and land-cover information obtained from the Ikonos image yielded a misclassification rate of 20.3\textendash 22.7\% for aquatic habitats, and 18.1\textendash 25.1\% for anopheline-positive larval habitats. Conclusion: One-metre spatial resolution Ikonos images combined with computer modelling based on topographic land-cover features are useful tools for identification of anopheline larval habitats, and they can be used to assist to malaria vector control in western Kenya highlands.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Ponds and lakes are abundant in Arctic permafrost lowlands. They play an important role in Arctic wetland ecosystems by regulating carbon, water, and energy fluxes and providing freshwater habitats. However, ponds, i.e., waterbodies with surface areas smaller than 1. 0 \texttimes{} 10\textsuperscript{4} m\textsuperscript{2}, have not been inventoried on global and regional scales. The Permafrost Region Pond and Lake (PeRL) database presents the results of a circum-Arctic effort to map ponds and lakes from modern (2002\textendash 2013) high-resolution aerial and satellite imagery with a resolution of 5 m or better. The database also includes historical imagery from 1948 to 1965 with a resolution of 6 m or better. PeRL includes 69 maps covering a wide range of environmental conditions from tundra to boreal regions and from continuous to discontinuous permafrost zones. Waterbody maps are linked to regional permafrost landscape maps which provide information on permafrost extent, ground ice volume, geology, and lithology. This paper describes waterbody classification and accuracy, and presents statistics of waterbody distribution for each site. Maps of permafrost landscapes in Alaska, Canada, and Russia are used to extrapolate waterbody statistics from the site level to regional landscape units. PeRL presents pond and lake estimates for a total area of 1. 4 \texttimes{} 10\textsuperscript{6} km\textsuperscript{2} across the Arctic, about 17 \% of the Arctic lowland ( \&lt; 300 m a.s.l.) land surface area. PeRL waterbodies with sizes of 1. 0 \texttimes{} 10\textsuperscript{6} m\textsuperscript{2} down to 1. 0 \texttimes{} 10\textsuperscript{2} m\textsuperscript{2} contributed up to 21 \% to the total water fraction. Waterbody density ranged from 1. 0 \texttimes{} 10 to 9. 4 \texttimes{} 10\textsuperscript{1} km\textsuperscript{-2}. Ponds are the dominant waterbody type by number in all landscapes representing 45\textendash 99 \% of the total waterbody number. The implementation of PeRL size distributions in land surface models will greatly improve the investigation and projection of surface inundation and carbon fluxes in permafrost lowlands.

Earlier, they were relatively straight, wide, braided, intermittent streams. However, percolation of irrigation water into and through valley alluvium has raised water tables, and flow regulation has produced more uniform flow into the rivers. As a result new floodplains formed, and bank and floodplain vegetation became denser, as if a climatic change to more humid conditions had occurred. The rivers became narrower and more sinuous due to perennial stream flow, abstraction of sediment with irrigation water, and a decrease in discharge during drought. Three reaches of these rivers responded differently to the changes. The South Platte River and a reach of the Arkansas River narrowed and developed a single thalweg. In contrast, a reach of the Arkansas River at Bent's Old Fort began to meander as a result of an increase of suspended sediment load. All of the reaches are near a pattern threshold.},

Within a boat-generated wave train a number of characteristics were measured and most showed a high correlation with measured rates of bank retreat. Maximum wave height within the train is the simplest measure and is associated with a major threshold in erosive energy on unconsolidated sandy alluvium at wave heights of 30 to 35 cm. At maximum wave heights above 35 cm all but the most resistant bank sediments erode. Reducing maximum wave heights to \textbackslash textless 30 cm by limiting boat speeds, and reducing the frequency of boat passages, caused a dramatic decline in bank erosion along the river.},

An improvement for dynamic unsteady one-dimensional (1-D) flow simulation based on Preissmann implicit finite difference scheme with simultaneous solution is developed. The river networks are described by a set of basic river reaches between two nodes. A procedure for automatically creating the order for controlling double-sweep is established. It then is applied for flood routing in the river network of a part of the Red river basin, Vietnam. From the results, the improvement is expected as an effective treatment for dynamicflood routing in river networksof dendritictype.},

  abstract = {The halocline in the Arctic Ocean plays an important role in regulating heat exchange at the bottom of the mixed layer and it has a direct effect on the ocean sea ice energy balance and sea ice mass balance. Modeling the halocline, however, remains a challenge in current state-of-the-art coupled ocean sea ice models including those that participated in the Arctic Ocean Model Intercomparison Project. In this study, we successfully reproduce a cold halocline in the Canada Basin by implementing a subgrid-scale brine rejection parameterization in an ocean general circulation model. The brine rejection scheme improves the solution by redistributing surface salts rejected during sea ice formation to their neutral buoyancy depths. The depths are based on salt plume physics and published laboratory and numerical experiments. Compared with hydrographic data from 1993 to 2004, distribution of most of the rejected salt to the bottom of the mixed layer seems to yield the lowest model-data misfits. We also show that the model's mixed layer depth is sensitive to the background diffusivity {$\nu$} used in the k-profile parameterization vertical mixing scheme. A background diffusivity of 10-6 m2/s in combination with brine rejection scheme described herein yield the best simulation of the Arctic halocline.},

  abstract = {The planform geometry and migration behaviour of confined meandering rivers at 23 locations in Alberta and British Columbia are examined. Relationships among planform geometry variables are generally consistent with those described for freely meandering rivers with small but significant differences because of the unique meander pattern of confined meanders. These exceptions are the ratio channel wavelength (l)/channel width (w) and the bend curvature (rm/w); in these confined meanders, the ratios exceed (l/w ??? 17; rm/w = 4.1) the free-meander norms (l/w = 8-14; rm/w = 2-3). In general, these migrating confined meandering rivers do not develop cutoffs, and meander bends appear to migrate downstream as a coherent waveform. Migration rates vary greatly, from 0.01 to 5.8 m/y, consistent with the general distribution of published rates for freely meandering rivers. Attempts to seek correlations between migration rate and channel flow and morphometry data are modestly successful. Stream power offers the best statistical predictor of migration rate, accounting for up to 52\% of variance in migration rate, greater than that provided by valley slope (34\%), bankfull width (32\%), and mean annual flood (30\%). Overall, the findings indicate that confined meandering rivers within western Canada may be more usefully regarded as part of a continuum of a meandering river pattern rather than as a unique river planform. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, sand\textemdash which accounts for 50\textendash 70\% of modern and ancient Mississippi delta deposits5,6 but comprises only 20\% of the sampled portion of the total load3\textemdash could be more important than mud for subaerial delta growth5. Historically, half of the Mississippi River sediment load is supplied by the Missouri River3. Here we analyse suspended sediment load data from two locations downstream from the lowest Missouri River dam to show that the measured sand load in the lower 1,100 km of the Mississippi River has not significantly diminished since dam construction. A one-dimensional numerical model of river morphodynamics predicts that the sand load feeding the delta will decrease only gradually over the next several centuries, with an estimated decline from current values of no more than about 17\% within the coming six centuries. We conclude that the lower Mississippi River channel holds a significant reservoir of sand that is available to replenish diminished loads via bed scour and substantially mitigate land loss.},

There is no remote-sensing method available to reliably monitor the permafrost thermal state. To estimate permafrost distribution at a hemispheric scale, we employ an equilibrium state model for the temperature at the top of the permafrost (TTOP model) for the 2000\textendash 2016 period, driven by remotely-sensed land surface temperatures, down-scaled ERA-Interim climate reanalysis data, tundra wetness classes and landcover map from the ESA Landcover Climate Change Initiative (CCI) project. Subgrid variability of ground temperatures due to snow and landcover variability is represented in the model using subpixel statistics. The results are validated against borehole measurements and reviewed regionally. The accuracy of the modelled mean annual ground temperature (MAGT) at the top of the permafrost is {$\pm$}2 \textdegree C when compared to permafrost borehole data. The modelled permafrost area (MAGT \textbackslash textless0 \textdegree C) covers 13.9 \texttimes{} 10 6 km 2 (ca. 15\% of the exposed land area), which is within the range or slightly below the average of previous estimates. The sum of all pixels having isolated patches, sporadic, discontinuous or continuous permafrost (permafrost probability \textbackslash textgreater0) is around 21 \texttimes{} 10 6 km 2 (22\% of exposed land area), which is approximately 2 \texttimes{} 10 6 km 2 less than estimated previously. Detailed comparisons at a regional scale show that the model performs well in sparsely vegetated tundra regions and mountains, but is less accurate in densely vegetated boreal spruce and larch forests.},

The intensity of precipitation extremes is widely held to increase proportionately to the increase in atmospheric water vapor content. Here, we show that this is not the case in 21st-century climate change scenarios simulated with climate models. In the tropics, precipitation extremes are not simulated reliably and do not change consistently among climate models; in the extratropics, they consistently increase more slowly than atmospheric water vapor content. We give a physical basis for how precipitation extremes change with climate and show that their changes depend on changes in the moist-adiabatic temperature lapse rate, in the upward velocity, and in the temperature when precipitation extremes occur. For the tropics, the theory suggests that improving the simulation of upward velocities in climate models is essential for improving predictions of precipitation extremes; for the extratropics, agreement with theory and the consistency among climate models increase confidence in the robustness of predictions of precipitation extremes under climate change.},

Erosion and recession of the river banks have constituted a threat to many villages along the various creeks in the delta area. Analyses of the recessional mechanisms indicate that bank failure is initiated by a fluvial erosion of the lower cohesionless bank layer at a much faster rate than the upper cohesive bank layer. This leads to development of overhangs of the upper cohesive materials. The failure mechanism of the river bank is complex, ranging from slip failures in high banks to shearing and toppling failures in low banks. The use of the common slip circle model for stability evaluation appears to be adequate only for high banks. Results obtained for the low banks suggest that the use of this model of stability analyses for low banks may yield misleading results. \textcopyright{} 1986.},

First, the Arctic is already changing rapidly as a result of climate change. Contemporary warm Arctic temperatures and large sea ice deficits (75\% volume loss) demonstrate climate states outside of previous experience. Modeled changes of the Arctic cryosphere demonstrate that even limiting global temperature increases to near 2~\textdegree C will leave the Arctic a much different environment by mid-century with less snow and sea ice, melted permafrost, altered ecosystems, and a projected annual mean Arctic temperature increase of +4~\textdegree C. Second, even under ambitious emission reduction scenarios, high-latitude land ice melt, including Greenland, are foreseen to continue due to internal lags, leading to accelerating global sea level rise throughout the century. Third, future Arctic changes may in turn impact lower latitudes through tundra greenhouse gas release and shifts in ocean and atmospheric circulation. Arctic-specific radiative and heat storage feedbacks may become an obstacle to achieving a stabilized global climate. In light of these trends, the precautionary principle calls for early adaptation and mitigation actions.},

A new fine-scale integrated surface/subsurface thermal hydrology modeling capability is described and demonstrated in proof-of-concept simulations. The new modeling capability combines a surface energy balance model with recently developed three-dimensional subsurface thermal hydrology models and new models for nonisothermal surface water flows and snow distribution in the microtopography. Surface water flows are modeled using the diffusion wave equation extended to include energy transport and phase change of ponded water. Variation of snow depth in the microtopography, physically the result of wind scour, is modeled phenomenologically with a diffusion wave equation. The multiple surface and subsurface processes are implemented by leveraging highly parallel community software. Fully integrated thermal hydrology simulations on the tilted open book catchment, an important test case for integrated surface/subsurface flow modeling, are presented. Fine-scale 100 year projections of the integrated permafrost thermal hydrological system on an ice wedge polygon at Barrow Alaska in a warming climate are also presented. These simulations demonstrate the feasibility of microtopography-resolving, process-rich simulations as a tool to help understand possible future evolution of the carbon-rich Arctic tundra in a warming climate.},

  abstract = {Dudhkumar River flows from upstream of India Border at Bhurungamari to the confluence with Brahmaputra River at Noonkhawa of Kurigram district having a stretch of 64 km in Bangladesh. Due to onrush of water from upstream in monsoon, erosion in Dudhkumar River takes a serious turn, threatening collapse of Sonahat Bridge in Bhurungamari, embankment on its right bank, dykes and several dwelling houses in recent years establishing the river as a destructive one. Thus study aiming at computing the long and short term bank line shifting along the river is of great significance. In this study, images of Landsat MSS and TM acquired from the year 1973 to 2015 have been used to investigate the riverbank migration pattern, accretion-erosion, rate of change of width, sinuosity and island dynamics of Dudhkumar River. For the short term analysis, migration rates are calculated from one Landsat image to the next. For long term analysis, the migration rates are calculated based on the difference between the 1973 image as the reference and subsequent images. From the short-term analysis, the mean erosion and accretion rate have been estimated as 128 m/y and 194 m/y on the left bank, and 141 and 176 m/y on the right bank indicating the accretion rate as greater than the erosion rate. Erosion rate has been found as greater in right bank rather than left bank and accretion rate is much more in left bank than the right bank. Due to high discharge, maximum erosion and accretion have been found as 349 m/y and 410 m/y respectively at left bank in 2013-2015 indicating the bank protection measures vulnerable. Computations on sinuosity of the river Dudhkumar River show that the sinuosity ranges from 1.36 to 1.53 showing significant increase in year 1989, 1997 and 2011 due to active erosion and deposition induced by monsoon flood. Analyses on island dynamics reveal that the island area started increasing after 1973 and maximum island area found in 2001. The analysis divulged that the Dudhkumar River is a highly meandering river with several critical sections where the river has been suffering enormously with erosion problem and shifting.The present study also identifies steadfast evidence on the dynamic fluvio-geomorphology of Dudhkumar River depicting urge for execution of erosion control schemes.},

  abstract = {The dramatic decline in Arctic sea ice cover is anticipated to influence atmospheric temperatures and circulation patterns. These changes will affect the terrestrial climate beyond the boundary of the Arctic, consequently modulating terrestrial snow cover. Therefore, an improved understanding of the relationship between Arctic sea ice and snow depth over the terrestrial Arctic is warranted. We examined responses of snow depth to the declining Arctic sea ice extent in September, during the period of 1979\textendash 2006. The major reason for a focus on snow depth, rather than snow cover, is because its variability has a climatic memory that impacts hydrothermal processes during the following summer season. Analyses of combined data sets of satellite measurements of sea ice extent and snow depth, simulated by a land surface model (CHANGE), suggested that an anomalously larger snow depth over northeastern Siberia during autumn and winter was significantly correlated to the declining September Arctic sea ice extent, which has resulted in cooling temperatures, along with an increase in precipitation. Meanwhile, the reduction of Arctic sea ice has amplified warming temperatures in North America, which has readily offset the input of precipitation to snow cover, consequently further decreasing snow depth. However, a part of the Canadian Arctic recorded an increase in snow depth driven locally by the diminishing September Arctic sea ice extent. Decreasing snow depth at the hemispheric scale, outside the northernmost regions (i.e., northeastern Siberia and Canadian Arctic), indicated that Arctic amplification related to the diminishing Arctic sea ice has already impacted the terrestrial Arctic snow depth. The strong reduction in Arctic sea ice anticipated in the future also suggests a potential long-range impact on Arctic snow cover. Moreover, the snow depth during the early snow season tends to contribute to the warming of soil temperatures in the following summer, at least in the northernmost regions.},

Four baseline data sets determine relations for bankfull geometry, i.e., bankfull depth, bankfull width, and down-channel slope as functions of bankfull discharge and bed surface median sediment size. These relations show a considerable degree of universality. This universality applies not only within the four sets used to determine the forms but also to three independent data sets as well. We study the physical basis for this universality in terms of four relations, the coefficients and exponents of which can be back calculated from the data: (1) a Manning-Strickler-type relation for channel resistance, (2) a channel-forming relation expressed in terms of the ratio of bankfull Shields number to critical Shields number, (3) a relation for critical Shields number as a function of dimensionless discharge, and (4) a ``gravel yield'' relation specifying the (estimated) gravel transport rate at bankfull flow as a function of bankfull discharge and gravel size. We use these underlying relations to explore why the dimensionless bankfull relations are only quasi-universal and to quantify the degree to which deviation from universality can be expected. The analysis presented here represents an alternative to extremal formulations to predict hydraulic geometry.},

The Yazoo River Basin in Mississippi is one example of a system which is experiencing excessive erosion and bank instability. The properties of bank materials are important in controlling the stability of stream banks and past studies have found that these properties are often variable spatially. Through an investigation of bank material properties on a stretch of Goodwin Creek in the Yazoo Basin, Mississippi, this study focuses on: i) how and why effective bank material properties vary through different scales; ii) how this variation impacts on the outputs from a bank stability model; and iii) how best to appropriately represent this variability within a bank stability model. The study demonstrates the importance that the variability of effective bank material properties has on bank stability: at both the micro-scale within a site, and at the meso-scale between sites in a reach. This variability was shown to have important implications for the usage of the Bank Stability and Toe Erosion Model (BSTEM), a deterministic bank stability model that currently uses a single value to describe each bank material property. As a result, a probabilistic representation of effective bank material strength parameters is recommended as a potential solution for any bank stability model that wishes to account for the important influence of the inherent variability of soil properties.},

Therefore, it is necessary to determine these relationships locally. The cantilever failure results revealed that the dominant failure mechanism of the experimental works is beam-type failure, while shear-type failure is the dominant failure in the U-Tapao River. Finally, a numerical model was developed based on a triple-grid approach to simulate the behaviour of a cantilever within the framework of fluvial erosion, cantilever failure, and bedload transportation. The simulated results showed good agreement with experimental results, and the U-Tapoa River in terms of the temporal variations of spatially averaged bank width, dominant failure mechanism, and overhanging block dimensions.},

The cover image \textemdash{} Chicago during the July 1995 heatwave \textemdash{} highlights one potential risk. Patz et al. consider the available evidence and suggest that climate warming already contributes to ill health and thousands of premature deaths across the world, and is likely to have serious health implications in the future. Recent work suggests that some regions are particularly at risk: areas where climate is dominated by El Ni\~no/Southern Oscillation events, sub-Saharan Africa, and sprawling urban areas subject to the heat island effect are already suffering from climate impacts and these are projected to increase. In many cases, regions at high risk are those least responsible for causing climate change.Sure thing All currently available climate models predict a near-surface warming trend under the influence of rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Barnett et al. evaluate the effect of such a warming trend on regional hydrology, particularly in snowmelt-dominated environments. They suggest that warming will cause a change from snowfall to rain, diminishing natural water storage capacity, as well as earlier melting of winter snow, shifting peak river runoff away from the periods of highest demand in summer and autumn. The reduction in glaciers and snow-packs are likely to have severe consequences for the water supply of one-sixth of the Earth's population.Water supply It is generally assumed that climate change will alter the hydrological cycle, but predicting which parts of the world will be drier and which will be wetter is a difficult problem. Milly et al. focus on streamflow and water availability trends and find that an ensemble of twelve current climate models accurately accounts for twentieth-century changes. The same models project potentially crucial regional effects on streamflow in the future that could threaten the availability of freshwater in many regions of the world by the year 2050.},

  abstract = {Length of river reaches is one of the most important characteristics of stream networks when applying hydrological or environmental simulation models. A common method of obtaining estimates of river lengths is based on deriving flow directions, accumulated area and drainage lines from raster digital elevation models (DEM). This method leads to length estimates with variable accuracy, which depends on DEM horizontal resolution, flatness of terrain, DEM vertical accuracy, the algorithm used to obtain flow directions and the way by which distances are calculated over raster structures. We applied an automatic river length extraction method for eight river reaches in the River Uruguay Basin (206000km2), in Southern Brazil, and compared its results to the lengths obtained from drainage vector lines digitalized over satellite images. Our results show that relative errors can be higher than 30\% in flat regions with relatively low DEM resolution. Preprocessing of DEM by the method known as stream burning greatly improves results, reducing errors to the range 1.9\textendash 7.4\%. Further improved estimates were obtained by applying optimized values for the length of orthogonal and diagonal steps called distance transforms, reducing the errors to the range -2.0\textendash 3.3\%.},

  abstract = {In the face of global population growth and the uneven distribution of water supply, a better knowledge of the spatial and temporal distribution of surface water resources is critical. Remote sensing provides a synoptic view of ongoing processes, which addresses the intricate nature of water surfaces and allows an assessment of the pressures placed on aquatic ecosystems. However, the main challenge in identifying water surfaces from remotely sensed data is the high variability of spectral signatures, both in space and time. In the last 10years only a few operational methods have been proposed to map or monitor surface water at continental or global scale, and each of them show limitations. The objectives of this study are to develop, demonstrate and validate the adequacy of a generic multi-temporal and multi-spectral image analysis method to detect water surfaces automatically, and to monitor them in near real-time at the African continental scale as a first step towards global scale coverage. The proposed approach, based on a transformation of the RGB color space into HSV, provides dynamic information at the continental scale. Two different validations were done at the continental scale over Africa: i) The algorithm validation checked the ability of the proposed algorithm to perform as effectively as human interpretation of the image: it showed an accuracy of 96.6\% and no commission errors. ii) The product validation was carried out by using an independent dataset derived from high resolution imagery: the continental permanent water surface product showed an accuracy of 91.5\% and few commission errors. Potential applications of the proposed method have been identified and discussed. The methodology that has been developed is generic: it can be applied to sensors with similar bands with good reliability, and minimal effort. Moreover, this experiment at the African continental scale showed that the methodology is efficient for a large range of environmental conditions. Additional preliminary tests over other continents indicate that the proposed methodology could also be applied at the global scale without too many difficulties.},

  abstract = {The location and persistence of surface water (inland and coastal) is both affected by climate and human activity1 and affects climate2,3, biological diversity4 and human wellbeing5,6. Global data sets documenting surface water location and seasonality have been produced from inventories and national descriptions7, statistical extrapolation of regional data8 and satellite imagery9,10,11,12, but measuring long-term changes at high resolution remains a challenge. Here, using three million Landsat satellite images13, we quantify changes in global surface water over the past 32 years at 30-metre resolution. We record the months and years when water was present, where occurrence changed and what form changes took in terms of seasonality and persistence. Between 1984 and 2015 permanent surface water has disappeared from an area of almost 90,000 square kilometres, roughly equivalent to that of Lake Superior, though new permanent bodies of surface water covering 184,000 square kilometres have formed elsewhere. All continental regions show a net increase in permanent water, except Oceania, which has a fractional (one per cent) net loss. Much of the increase is from reservoir filling, although climate change14 is also implicated. Loss is more geographically concentrated than gain. Over 70 per cent of global net permanent water loss occurred in the Middle East and Central Asia, linked to drought and human actions including river diversion or damming and unregulated withdrawal15,16. Losses in Australia17 and the USA18 linked to long-term droughts are also evident. This globally consistent, validated data set shows that impacts of climate change and climate oscillations on surface water occurrence can be measured and that evidence can be gathered to show how surface water is altered by human activities. We anticipate that this freely available data will improve the modelling of surface forcing, provide evidence of state and change in wetland ecotones (the transition areas between biomes), and inform water-management decision-making.},

  abstract = {In the classic model for oriented thaw lakes, sublittoral shelves form by wind-driven circulation near shorelines oriented perpendicular to the wind, protecting the adjacent banks from thaw and wave cut erosion. Here I propose an alternative model based on thaw slumping and test the model predictions against observations in northern Alaska. Thermal modeling illustrates that bank height controls the rate of thaw slumping because summertime thaw penetrates only decimeters into a tall bank but as much as tens of meters into a short bank. This effect also leads to oriented lakes because of a nonlinear relationship between bank height and bank retreat rate. Bank material texture also controls the rate of thaw slumping because fine-grained sediments drain slowly and maintain higher pore pressures than coarse-grained sediments, resulting in lower critical angles for slumping. To test the thaw slumping model quantitatively, I constructed a process-based numerical model that includes thaw slumping, lacustrine sediment dispersal, and thaw-driven lake floor subsidence. The model predicts that lake orientations and aspect ratios are controlled by topographic aspect and slope, not by wind direction and intensity. The thaw slumping model further predicts inverse correlations between lake area and bank height and between lake area and bank material texture. An analysis of oriented thaw lakes in northern Alaska shows that systematically smaller, deeper lakes form in coarse-grained eolian sediments compared with those formed in fine-grained fluvial marine sediments. This pattern strongly supports the thaw slumping model.},

Here we present E3SM global simulations using active ocean and sea ice that are driven by the Coordinated Ocean-ice Reference Experiments II (CORE-II) interannual atmospheric forcing data set. The E3SM ocean and sea ice components are MPAS-Ocean and MPAS-Seaice, which use the Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS) framework and run on unstructured horizontal meshes. For this study, grid cells vary from 30 to 60 km for the low-resolution mesh and 6 to 18 km at high resolution. The vertical grid is a structured z-star coordinate and uses 60 and 80 layers for low and high resolution, respectively. The lower-resolution simulation was run for five CORE cycles (310 years) with little drift in sea surface temperature (SST) or heat content. The meridional heat transport (MHT) is within observational range, while the meridional overturning circulation at 26.5\textdegree N is low compared to observations. The largest temperature biases occur in the Labrador Sea and western boundary currents (WBCs), and the mixed layer is deeper than observations at northern high latitudes in the winter months. In the Antarctic, maximum mixed layer depths (MLD) compare well with observations, but the spatial MLD pattern is shifted relative to observations. Sea ice extent, volume, and concentration agree well with observations. At high resolution, the sea surface height compares well with satellite observations in mean and variability.},

With almost 90,000 deaths recorded by UCDP last year, 2017 saw a decrease for the third consecutive year to a level 32\% lower than the latest peak in 2014. This trend in declining levels of organized violence is driven by state-based armed conflict, and by the case of Syria in particular. Forty-nine state-based conflicts were active in 2017, down by four compared to 2016, and ten of these reached the level of war, with at least 1,000 battle-related deaths. The overall decrease in fatalities lends support to the claim that conflict deaths are in decline and that the world is increasingly peaceful. This trend holds even more strongly when controlling for increases in world population. In contrast, non-state conflict has increased: a new peak of 82 active non-state conflicts was recorded in 2017 and fatalities have increased concurrently. Much of this is due to escalating violence in DR Congo and the Central African Republic. However, fatalities from non-state conflict remain but 15\% of the total number of fatalities from organized violence. As for actors engaged in one-sided violence, their number also increased during 2017, although the number of fatalities remained at the same level as in 2016.},

To better understand changes in extreme precipitation, they may be decomposed into contributions from atmospheric thermodynamics and dynamics5,6,7, but these are typically diagnosed with spatially aggregated data8,9 or using a statistical approach that is not valid at all locations10,11. Here we decompose the forced response of daily regional scale extreme precipitation in climate-model simulations into thermodynamic and dynamic contributions using a robust physical diagnostic8. We show that thermodynamics alone would lead to a spatially homogeneous fractional increase, which is consistent across models and dominates the sign of the change in most regions. However, the dynamic contribution modifies regional responses, amplifying increases, for instance, in the Asian monsoon region, but weakening them across the Mediterranean, South Africa and Australia. Over subtropical oceans, the dynamic contribution is strong enough to cause robust regional decreases in extreme precipitation, which may partly result from a poleward circulation shift. The dynamic contribution is key to reducing uncertainties in future projections of regional extreme precipitation.},

  abstract = {The distribution of large woody debris (LWD) was studied along the concave outer bend of th ree meanders in the Ain River, a 195-km-long tributary of the upper Rhone River. The Ain River is a sixth-order channel dominated by a gravel-cobble bed substrate that meanders through a floodplain covered largely by riparian forest vegetation. The mass of LWD was measured in a 15-m-wide forest band along the three meander bends, with total loads calculated to be 56.1 t ha(-1) at the Mellon study site, compared with 22.9 and 21.5 t ha(-1) at the study sites of Bublane and Blyes, respectively The distribution of LWD within any one meander concavity was dependent on three main variables: (1) the position of the concavity in relation to the main flow axis, (2) the height of the bank, and (3) the presence and position of overbank flow channels in the concavity. The type of vegetation community along the channel margin is nondiscriminating, favoring the conclusion that the LWD comes mainly from upstream of the bends rather than locally. The relative influence of each variable is contrasted between the three study sites. The total LWD deposited along concavities was most strongly controlled by meander-bend geometry. The supply areas for LWD, located a few kilometers upstream from the study sites, were also found to influence total LWD along concavities. Findings from this study are applicable to managing instream large woody debris as part of ongoing efforts to restore alluvial forests along French rivers.},

Soils were highly cryoturbated, and organic carbon (OC) stores ranged from 13 to 162 kg OC m-2 in banks above sea level and averaged 63 kg OC m-2 over the entire coastline. Long-term (1950\textendash 2000) annual lateral fluxes due to erosion were estimated at -153 Gg OC, -7762 Mg total nitrogen, -2106 Tg solids, and -2762 Tg water. Total land area loss along the Alaska Beaufort Sea coastline was estimated at 203 ha yr-1. We found coastal erosion rates, bank heights, soil properties, and material stores and fluxes to be extremely variable among sampling sites. In comparing two classification systems used to classifying coastline types from an oceanographic, coastal morphology perspective and geomorphic units from a terrestrial, soils perspective, we found both systems were effective at differentiating significant differences among classes for most material stores, but the coastline classification did not find significant differences in erosion rates because it lacked differentiation of soil texture.},

Designed for global-scale climate simulations and having coarse spatial resolutions (from {$\sim$}250 km (ref. 6) to 800 km (ref. 7)) such models are now being used to evaluate climatological and hydrological quantities at or near the land surface and at sub-continental scales8\textendash 10. They are also being used to provide input data for high-resolution simulations, predicting, for example, the effects of increasing atmospheric CO2 at regional scales11. Here we show that continental surface climatologies and climate change predictions for tropical forest ecotypes derived from general circulation models may be very sensitive to slight modifications in the land-surface/atmosphere coupling. Specifically our results indicate that improving the realism of the areal distribution of precipitation alters the balance between runoff and evaporation. In the case of a tropical forest, we find that by modifying the area over which rainfall is distributed, the surface climatology is changed from an evaporation-dominated regime to one dominated by runoff. Climate studies using near-surface output from such simulations may therefore be misleading.},

  abstract = {Data from the Brandywine Creek in Pennsylvania and the South River in Virginia document spatial and temporal patterns describing the retreat of gently curving bends with forested riparian zones containing a mix of very large and smaller trees, cohesive banks, and slow rates of migration ({$\sim$} 0.1 m/yr). Field data include 2.5 years of bank profile surveys, measurements of tree morphology, and ground-based laser scanner (LiDAR) surveys repeated biannually. These banks retreat through a cycle of erosion on decadal timescales. Initially, small volumes (mean = 0.173 m3per bank erosion event) of soil are removed between large trees growing on the bank. Near trees, the rate of bank retreat is initially negligible, creating a scalloped bank morphology buttressed by large trees. As the trees are increasingly exposed to the flow, they become slowly undercut, gradually leaning into the channel and sliding down to the toe of the bank, eventually toppling into the river after a few years, which restarts the cycle. A magnitude-frequency analysis of monitoring data from the Brandywine Creek indicates that the effective bank erosion event only 0.11 m3; thus, forested bank retreat is dominated by small soil failures. Large erosion events, many associated with trees toppling into the river, greatly increase the variance of time-averaged rates of bank erosion, such that almost 4 years of monitoring are needed to measure time-averaged rates of erosion to within an accuracy of 10\%. Because of the limited spatial extent of our survey data and the absence of large discharges, these results are provisional. Improved process-based models to predict the retreat of forested riverbanks should account for the spatial structure of riparian forests and the interactions between the flow, the gradual removal of bank soils, and the ongoing efforts of the trees to remain attached to the bank. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Polyakov et al. show that this region is also evolving toward a state of weakened stratification with increased vertical mixing, release of oceanic heat, and less sea ice. These changes could have considerable impacts on other geophysical and biogeochemical aspects of the Arctic Ocean system and presage a fundamentally new Arctic climate state. Science, this issue p. 285 Arctic sea-ice loss is a leading indicator of climate change and can be attributed, in large part, to atmospheric forcing. Here, we show that recent ice reductions, weakening of the halocline, and shoaling of the intermediate-depth Atlantic Water layer in the eastern Eurasian Basin have increased winter ventilation in the ocean interior, making this region structurally similar to that of the western Eurasian Basin. The associated enhanced release of oceanic heat has reduced winter sea-ice formation at a rate now comparable to losses from atmospheric thermodynamic forcing, thus explaining the recent reduction in sea-ice cover in the eastern Eurasian Basin. This encroaching ``atlantification'' of the Eurasian Basin represents an essential step toward a new Arctic climate state, with a substantially greater role for Atlantic inflows.

  abstract = {In late June 2013, heavy rainfall and rapidly melting alpine snow triggered flooding throughout much of the southern half of Alberta. Heavy rainfall commenced on 19 June and continued for 3 days. When the event was over, more than 200 mm and as much as 350 mm of precipitation had fallen over the Front Ranges of the Canadian Rocky Mountains. Tributaries to the Bow River including the Ghost, Kananaskis, Elbow, Sheep and Highwood, and many of their tributaries, all reached flood levels. The storm had a large spatial extent causing flooding to the north and south in the Red Deer and Oldman Basins, and also to the west in the Elk River in British Columbia. Convergence of the nearly synchronous floodwaters downstream in the South Saskatchewan River system caused record high releases from Lake Diefenbaker through Gardiner Dam. Dam releases in Alberta and Saskatchewan attenuated the downstream flood peak such that only moderate flooding occurred in Saskatchewan and Manitoba. More than a dozen municipalities declared local states of emergency; numerous communities were placed under evacuation order in Alberta and Saskatchewan. The media reported that more than 100,000 people needed to evacuate their homes, and five people died. At CAD\$6 billion, the Province of Alberta estimated that it was the costliest natural disaster in Canadian history. At their peak, the water levels were the highest in the past 60 years, and nearing those of historic events of the late 1800s and early 1900s where records exist. There was major damage to infrastructure roads, bridges and culverts. Downtown Calgary was inundated, as were many communities such as High River and Bragg Creek. Debris flows and debris torrents affected communities such as Canmore and Exshaw, and isolated many mountain communities including closing the TransCanada Highway for several days. Environment Canada called it the ``Flood of Floods.'' Insured losses of CAD\$2 billion included thousands of cars and homes demolished and damaged by backed-up sewers. Flood damage losses and recovery costs from the flood are projected to exceed CAD\$6 billion.},

  abstract = {The headwaters of many rivers are characterized by gullies and incised streams that generate significant volumes of sediment and degrade downstream water quality. These systems are characterized by harsh climates, ephemeral flows that do not reach bank top, and bare cohesive banks of clay and weathered bedrock. We investigated the rates and processes of bank erosion in an incised canal that has such characteristics. Detailed measurements of bank position were made over two years with a purpose-built groundprofiler and photo-electronic erosion pins (PEEPs). Stage height and turbidity were also monitored. The bare banks eroded at 13 {$\pm$} 2 mm a-1. Erosion is controlled by subaerial processes that loosen bank material. Observations show that needle-ice growth is important in winter and desiccation of clays predominates in summer. Flows are unable to erode firm cohesive clays from the banks, and erosion is generally limited by the availability of loosened material. This produces strong hysteresis in turbidity during events. Peak turbidity is related to the number of days with low flow between events, and not peak stage. Rehabilitation with a moderate cover of grass is able to prevent bank erosion by limiting the subaerial erosion processes. Projections of current erosion suggest that without vegetation cover the banks are unlikely to stabilize for many years. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Ice is present during a part of the year on many rivers of cold, and even temperate, regions of the globe. Though largely ignored in hydrological literature, river ice has serious hydrologic impacts, including extreme flood events caused by ice jams, interference with transportation and energy production, low winter flows and associated ecological and water quality consequences. It is also a major factor in the life cycle of many aquatic and other species, being both beneficial and destructive, depending on location and time of year. A brief review of the hydrologic aspects of river ice shows strong climatic links and illustrates the sensitivity of the entire ice regime to changes in climatic conditions. To date, this sensitivity has only partly been documented: the vast majority of related studies have focused on the timing of freeze-up and break-up over the past century, and indicate trends that are consistent with concomitant changes in air temperature. It is only in the past few years that attention has been paid to the more complex, and practically more important, question of what climatic change may do to the frequency and severity of extreme ice jams, floods and low flows. The probable changes to the ice regime of rivers, and associated hydrological processes and impacts, are discussed in the light of current understanding.

The framework is based on the unbounded Couette model, which makes it possible to decouple the destabilizing effects of spatially uniform shear from instabilities caused by the presence of inflection points in velocity profiles. The basic state is assumed to be time dependent, which reflects the role of internal waves in controlling fine-scale shear. Linear stability analysis suggests that conditions for thermohaline-shear instability are met in most ocean regions where temperature and salinity concurrently increase downward. We conclude that thermohaline-shear instability represents a plausible mechanism for the initiation of active diffusive convection, which, in turn, is essential for the formation of thermohaline staircases and maintenance of double-diffusive interleaving.},

  abstract = {Hydrologic cycle intensification is an expected manifestation of a warming climate. Although positive trends in several global average quantities have been reported, no previous studies have documented broad intensification across elements of the Arctic freshwater cycle (FWC). In this study, the authors examine the character and quantitative significance of changes in annual precipitation, evapotranspiration, and river discharge across the terrestrial pan-Arctic over the past several decades from observations and a suite of coupled general circulation models (GCMs). Trends in freshwater flux and storage derived from observations across the Arctic Ocean and surrounding seas are also described. With few exceptions, precipitation, evapotranspiration, and river discharge fluxes from observations and the GCMs exhibit positive trends. Significant positive trends above the 90\{\%\} confidence level, however, are not present for all of the observations. Greater confidence in the GCM trends arises through lower in- terannual variability relative to trend magnitude. Put another way, intrinsic variability in the observations tends to limit confidence in trend robustness. Ocean fluxes are less certain, primarily because of the lack of long-term observations. Where available, salinity and volume flux data suggest some decrease in saltwater inflow to the Barents Sea (i.e., a decrease in freshwater outflow) in recent decades. A decline in freshwater storage across the central Arctic Ocean and suggestions that large-scale circulation plays a dominant role in freshwater trends raise questions as to whether Arctic Ocean freshwater flows are intensifying. Although oceanic fluxes of freshwater are highly variable and consistent trends are difficult to verify, the other com- ponents of the ArcticFWCdo show consistent positive trends over recent decades. The broad-scale increases provide evidence that the ArcticFWCis experiencing intensification. Efforts that aim to develop an adequate observation system are needed to reduce uncertainties and to detect and document ongoing changes in all system components for further evidence of Arctic FWC intensification.},

Global estimates of CO2 evasion have been hampered, however, by the lack of a framework for estimating the inland water surface area and gas transfer velocity and by the absence of a global CO2 database. Here we report regional variations in global inland water surface area, dissolved CO2 and gas transfer velocity. We obtain global CO2 evasion rates of 1.8 petagrams of carbon (Pg C) per year from streams and rivers and 0.32 Pg C yr-1 from lakes and reservoirs, where the upper and lower limits are respectively the 5th and 95th confidence interval percentiles. The resulting global evasion rate of 2.1 Pg C yr-1 is higher than previous estimates owing to a larger stream and river evasion rate. Our analysis predicts global hotspots in stream and river evasion, with about 70 per cent of the flux occurring over just 20 per cent of the land surface. The source of inland water CO2 is still not known with certainty and new studies are needed to research the mechanisms controlling CO2 evasion globally.},

  abstract = {Arctic rivers typically transport more than half of their annual amounts of water and suspended sediments during spring floods. In this study, the Sagavanirktok, Kuparuk and Colville rivers in the Alaskan Arctic were sampled during the spring floods of 2001 to determine levels of total suspended solids (TSS) and dissolved and particulate metals and organic carbon. Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) increased from 167 to 742 {$\mu$}mol/L during peak discharge in the Sagavanirktok River, at about the same time that river flow increased to maximum levels. Concentrations of dissolved Cu, Pb, Zn and Fe in the Sagavanirktok River followed trends observed for DOC with 3- to 25-fold higher levels at peak flow than during off-peak discharge. Similar patterns were found for the Kuparuk and Colville rivers, where average concentrations of dissolved trace metals and DOC were even higher. These observations are linked to a large pulse of DOC and dissolved metals incorporated into snowmelt from thawing ponds and upper soil layers. In contrast with Cu, Fe, Pb and Zn, concentrations of dissolved Ba did not increase in response to increased discharge of water, TSS and DOC. Concentrations of particulate Cu, Fe, Pb and Zn were more uniform than observed for their respective dissolved species and correlated well with the Al content of the suspended particles. However, concentrations of particulate Al were poorly correlated with particulate organic carbon. Results from this study show that {$>$}80\% of the suspended sediment and more than one-third of the annual inputs of dissolved Cu, Fe, Pb, Zn and DOC were carried to the coastal Beaufort Sea in 3 and 12 d, respectively, by the Kuparuk and Sagavanirktok rivers.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews recent developments in modelling the two main sets of bank-erosion processes and mechanisms, namely fluvial erosion and mass failure, before suggesting an avenue for research to make further progress in the future. Our review of mass failure mechanisms reveals that the traditional use of limit equilibrium methods to analyse bank stability has in recent years been supplemented by research that has made progress in understanding and modelling the role of positive and negative pore water pressures, confining river pressures, and hydrograph characteristics. While understanding of both fluvial erosion and mass failure processes has improved in recent years, we identify a key limitation in that few studies have examined the nature of the interaction between these processes. We argue that such interactions are likely to be important in gravel-bed rivers and present new simulations in which fluvial erosion, pore water pressure, and limit equilibrium stability models are combined into a fully coupled analysis. The results suggest that existing conceptual models, which describe how bank materials are delivered to the fluvial sediment transfer system, may need to be revised to account for the unforeseen effects introduced by feedback between the interacting processes. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Our analysis combines a model of fluvial bank erosion with groundwater flow and bank stability analyses to account for the influence of hydraulic erosion on mass failure processes, the key novel aspect being that the fluvial erosion model is parameterized using outputs from detailed hydrodynamic simulations. The results identify two mechanisms that explain how most bank retreat usually occurs after, rather than during, flood peaks. First, in the high curvature bend investigated here the maximum flow velocity core migrates away from the outer bank as flow discharge increases, reducing sidewall boundary shear stress and fluvial erosion at peak flow stages. Second, bank failure episodes are triggered by combinations of pore water and hydrostatic confining pressures induced in the period between the drawdown and rising phases of multipeaked flow events.},

Yet the fate of this heat remains uncertain3, partly because the water is relatively saline, and thus dense: it therefore enters the Arctic Ocean at intermediate depths and is separated from surface waters by stratification. Vertical mixing is generally weak within the Arctic Ocean basins, with very modest heat fluxes (0.05\textendash 0.3 W m-2) arising largely from double diffusion4,5,6,7,8. However, geographically limited observations have indicated substantially enhanced turbulent mixing rates over rough topography9,10,11,12,13,14. Here we present pan-Arctic microstructure measurements of turbulent kinetic energy dissipation. Our measurements further demonstrate that the enhanced continental slope dissipation rate, and by implication vertical mixing, varies significantly with both topographic steepness and longitude. Furthermore, our observations show that dissipation is insensitive to sea-ice conditions. We identify tides as the main energy source that supports the enhanced dissipation, which generates vertical heat fluxes of more than 50 W m-2. We suggest that the increased transfer of momentum from the atmosphere to the ocean as Arctic sea ice declines is likely to lead to an expansion of mixing hotspots in the future Arctic Ocean.},

  abstract = {Sea ice is composed of discrete floes, which range in size across orders of magnitude. Here we present a model that represents the joint distribution of sea ice thickness and floe size. Unlike previous studies, we do not impose a particular form on the subgrid-scale floe size distribution. Floe sizes are determined prognostically by the interaction of five key physical processes: new ice formation, welding of floes in freezing conditions, lateral growth and melt, and fracture of floes by ocean surface waves. Coupled model results suggest that these processes capture first-order characteristics of the floe size distribution, including decay in the distribution with increasing floe size and basin-wide spatial variability in representative radius. Lateral melt and floe welding are particularly important, with wave fracture creating floes at preferred sizes. The addition of floe size dependence to the existing model physics results in significant reductions in sea ice concentration, particularly in summer and principally due to floe size-dependent lateral melt. The increased lateral melt alters partitioning of the melting potential, which reduces basal melt and increases sea ice thickness in some locations. These results suggest that including a floe size distribution may be important for accurate simulation of the polar climate system.},

  abstract = {We have derived an analytic form of the thickness redistribution function, {$\Psi$}, and compressive strength of sea ice using variational principles. By using the technique of coarse-graining vertical sea ice deformation, or ridging, in the momentum equation of the pack, we isolate frictional energy loss from potential energy gain in the collision of floes. The method accounts for macroporosity of ridge rubble, {$\phi$}R, and by including this in the state space of the pack, we expand the sea ice thickness distribution, g(h), to a bivariate distribution, g(h,{$\phi$}R). The effect of macroporosity is for the first time included in the large-scale mass conservation and momentum equations of frozen oceans. We make assumptions that have simplified the problem, such as treating sea ice as a granular material in ridges, and assuming that bending moments associated with ridging are perturbations around an isostatic state. Regardless of these simplifications, the coarse-grained ridge model is highly predictive of macroporosity and ridge shape. By ensuring that vertical sea ice deformation observes a variational principle both at the scale of individual ridges and over the pack as a whole, we can predict distributions of ridge shapes using equations that can be solved in Earth system models. Our method also offers the possibility of more accurate derivations of sea ice thickness from ice freeboard measured by space-borne altimeters over polar oceans.},

Using output from five coupled and uncoupled configurations of the Los Alamos Sea Ice Model, CICE, we formulate quality control methods that exploit common statistical properties of sea-ice thickness, and test for significant changes in model results in a computationally efficient manner. New additions and changes to CICE are graded into four categories, ranging from bit-for-bit amendments to significant, answer-changing upgrades. These modifications are assessed using criteria that account for the high level of autocorrelation in sea-ice time series, along with a quadratic skill metric that searches for hemispheric changes in model answers across an array of different CICE configurations. These metrics also provide objective guidance for assessing new physical representations and code functionality.This article is part of the theme issue `Modelling of sea-ice phenomena'.},

Its purpose is to ingest satellite- and ground-based observational data products, using advanced land surface modeling and data assimilation techniques, in order to generate optimal fields of land surface states and fluxes. GLDAS is unique in that it is an uncoupled land surface modeling system that drives multiple models, integrates a huge quantity of observation-based data, runs globally at high resolution (0.25\textdegree ), and produces results in near\textendash real time (typically within 48 h of the present). GLDAS is also a test bed for innovative modeling and assimilation capabilities. A vegetation-based ``tiling'' approach is used to simulate subgrid-scale variability, with a 1-km global vegetation dataset as its basis. Soil and elevation parameters are based on high-resolution global datasets. Observation-based precipitation and downward radiation and output fields from the best available global coupled atmospheric data assimilation systems are employed as forcing data. The high-quality, global land surface fields provided by GLDAS will be used to initialize weather and climate prediction models and will promote various hydrometeorological studies and applications. The ongoing GLDAS archive (started in 2001) of modeled and observed, global, surface meteorological data, parameter maps, and output is publicly available.},

  abstract = {Problems are often encountered in accurately establishing the rates of processes associated with river channel change. In this study, optical dating was used to obtain the lateral migration rate of an abandoned meander bend on the Klip River, eastern Free State, South Africa. Five samples were collected by augering along a transect across an approximately 200-m-wide scroll-bar sequence on the inner meander bend, and an additional sample was collected from the channel fill of the related oxbow lake. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages were derived for each sample using the single-aliquot regenerative-dose protocol on small aliquots of quartz. Incomplete bleaching was evident in some of the samples and thus the appropriate statistical analysis was performed using the 'finite mixture model' for the scroll-bar samples and the 'minimum age model' for the channel-fill sample. The ages calculated were in the correct chronological order for the depositional sequence, which was formed over the last \&sim; 1000 years. The average rate of lateral migration across the scroll-bar sequence was found to be \&sim; 0.16 m/yr but with an apparent increase in the rate occurring during the early sixteenth century. Where quartz-rich alluvium exists, the methods used in this study can potentially be applied to other river systems, enabling rates of channel change processes to be determined.

This raises the question of whether dynamic variation in individual sexual behavior is a real phenomenon that can be observed and measured. To study this dynamic variation, we developed a model incorporating heterogeneity in both between-person and within-person sexual contact patterns. Using novel methodology that we call iterated filtering for longitudinal data, we fitted this model by maximum likelihood to longitudinal survey data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Collaborative HIV Seroincidence Study (1992\textendash 1995). We found evidence for individual heterogeneity in sexual behavior over time. We simulated an epidemic process and found that inclusion of empirically measured levels of dynamic variation in individual-level sexual behavior brought the theoretical predictions of HIV incidence into closer alignment with reality given the measured per-act probabilities of transmission. The methods developed here provide a framework for quantifying variation in sexual behaviors that helps in understanding the HIV epidemic among gay men.},

  abstract = {Observations indicate that over the past several decades, geomorphic processes in the Arctic have been changing or intensifying. Coastal erosion, which currently supplies most of the sediment and carbon to the Arctic Ocean [Rachold et al., 2000], may have doubled since 1955 [Mars and Houseknecht, 2007]. Further inland, expansion of channel networks [Toniolo et al., 2009] and increased river bank erosion [Costard et al., 2007] have been attributed to warming. Lakes, ponds, and wetlands appear to be more dynamic, growing in some areas, shrinking in others, and changing distribution across lowland regions [e.g., Smith et al., 2005]. On the Arctic coastal plain, recent degradation of frozen ground previously stable for thousands of years suggests 10\textendash 30\% of lowland and tundra landscapes may be affected by even modest warming [Jorgenson et al., 2006]. In headwater regions, hillslope soil erosion and landslides are increasing [e.g., Gooseff et al., 2009].},

  abstract = {Remotely sensed imagery of rivers has long served as a means for characterizing channel properties and detection of planview change. In the last decade the dramatic increase in the availability of satellite imagery and processing tools has created the potential to greatly expand the spatial and temporal scale of our understanding of river morphology and dynamics. To date, the majority of GIS and automated analyses of planview changes in rivers from remotely sensed data has been developed for single-threaded meandering river systems. These methods have limited applicability to many of the earth's rivers with complex multi-channel planforms. Here we present the methodologies of a set of analysis algorithms collectively called Spatially Continuous Riverbank Erosion and Accretion Measurements (SCREAM). SCREAM analyzes planview river metrics regardless of river morphology. These algorithms quantify both the erosion and accretion rates of riverbanks from binary masks of channels generated from imagery acquired at two time periods. Additionally, the program quantifies the area of change between river channels and the surrounding floodplain and area of islands lost or formed between these two time periods. To examine variations in erosion rates in relation to local channel attributes and make rate comparisons between river systems of varying sizes, the program determines channel widths and bank curvature at every bank pixel. SCREAM was developed and tested on rivers with diverse and complex planform morphologies in imagery acquired from a range of observational platforms with varying spatial resolutions. Validation and verification of SCREAM-generated metrics against manual measurements show no significant measurement errors in determination of channel width, erosion, and bank aspects. SCREAM has the potential to provide data for both the quantitative examination of the controls on erosion rates and for the comparison of these rates across river systems ranging broadly in size and planform morphology.},

Our results indicate that in the upper Amazon region, primary succession on newly deposited riverine soils is a major mode of forest regeneration. Landsat imagery analyses show that 26.6\% of the modern lowland forest has characteristics of recent erosional and depositional activity; 12.0\% of the Peruvian lowland forest is in successional stages along rivers. This successional development is used to classify the western Amazon rainforests according to their geomorphological erosion\textendash deposition pattern. We also propose that by causing high site turnover, disturbance and variation in forest structure, the river dynamics may be a major factor creating and maintaining the high between-habitat ({$\beta$}-type) species diversity characterizing the upper Amazon1.},

Yet, future changes in LPS activity are poorly understood, due in part to inadequate representation of these storms in current climate models. Using a high-resolution atmospheric general circulation model that realistically simulates the genesis distribution of LPS, here we show that Indian monsoon LPS activity declines about 45\% by the late 21st century in simulations of a business-as-usual emission scenario. The distribution of LPS genesis shifts poleward as it weakens, with oceanic genesis decreasing by {$\sim$}60\% and continental genesis increasing by {$\sim$}10\%; over land the increase in storm counts is accompanied by a shift toward lower storm wind speeds. The weakening and poleward shift of the genesis distribution in a warmer climate are confirmed and attributed, via a statistical model, to the reduction and poleward shift of low-level absolute vorticity over the monsoon region, which in turn are robust features of most coupled model projections. The poleward shift in LPS activity results in an increased frequency of extreme precipitation events over northern India.},

  abstract = {Sediment connectivity in fluvial networks results from the transfer of sediment between multiple sources and sinks. Connectivity scales differently between all sources and sinks as a function of distance, source grain size and sediment supply, network topology and topography, and hydrologic forcing. In this paper, we address the challenge of quantifying sediment connectivity and its controls at the network scale. We expand the concept of a single, catchment-scale sediment cascade toward representing sediment transport from each source as a suite of individual cascading processes. We implement this approach in the herein presented CAtchment Sediment Connectivity And DElivery (CASCADE) modeling framework. In CASCADE, each sediment cascade establishes connectivity between a specific source and its multiple sinks. From a source perspective, the fate of sediment is controlled by its detachment and downstream transport capacity, resulting in a specific trajectory of transfer and deposition. From a sink perspective, the assemblage of incoming cascades defines provenance, sorting, and magnitude of sediment deliveries. At the network scale, this information reveals emerging patterns of connectivity and the location of bottlenecks, where disconnectivity occurs. In this paper, we apply CASCADE to quantitatively analyze the sediment connectivity of a major river system in SE Asia. The approach provides a screening model that can support analyses of large, poorly monitored river systems. We test the sensitivity of CASCADE to various parameters and identify the distribution of energy between the multiple, simultaneously active sediment cascades as key control behind network sediment connectivity. To conclude, CASCADE enables a quantitative, spatially explicit analysis of network sediment connectivity with potential applications in both river science and management.},

  author = {Schramm, Imke},
  abstract = {This study presents the application of the hydrological model TopoFlow to the Imnavait Creek watershed, a small arctic headwater basin in northern Alaska. This new process-based, spatially distributed model is executed for the years 2001 to 2003. The model is evaluated for its capability to reproduce the different components of the hydrological cycle. Simulations are done for different climate change scenarios to lend insight into the impacts of global change on hydrological processes. Imnavait Creek ({$\sim$}2 km{$\lnot\leq$}) is underlain by continuous permafrost and two features characterize the channel network: The stream is beaded, and numerous water tracks are distributed along the hillslopes. These facts, together with the constraint of the subsurface system to the shallow active layer, strongly influence the runoff-response to rain or snowmelt. Climatic conditions vary greatly during the years of this study, providing a good testing of model capabilities. Streamflow is the dominant form of basin water loss (64\% of the water budget). In 2001, snowmelt runoff is the dominant runoff event, whereas in 2003, the summer runoff generated by continuous rainfall surpasses the melt discharge. A single and exceptionally high rainfall causes the dominant runoff event in 2002. Water loss due to evapotranspiration achieves considerable amounts, ranging from 28\% to 57\% of the water budget. Simulation results indicate that the model performs quantitatively well, and achieves best results in 2002. Measured and predicted cumulative discharges are in a good agreement. The different components of the water cycle are represented in the model, with refinements necessary in the qualitative reproduction of some sub-processes: Snow damming results in later melt discharge than modeled. Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients between 0.3 and 0.9 reveal that the model requires further refinement in the small-scale, short-term reproduction of storage-related processes. The deviations can be attributed to the facts that the beaded stream system, the spatial variability of the active layer depth, and the complex soil moisture distribution are not sufficiently well represented in the model. Furthermore, the model is highly sensitive to the setting of the initial water table. While various studies document recently observed climate changes, there remains uncertainty of how these changes will impact the hydrological cycle of the Arctic. Depending on the relative increases in temperature and precipitation, this will result in enhanced or diminished runoff and soil moisture. This study suggests that an 8\% increase in summer precipitation balances the increased water loss due to evapotranspiration caused by a temperature increase of 2{$\lnot\int$}C.},

Flood waves and related processes are observed globally, through either river gauging networks or remote sensing acquisitions. River gauging stations are declining globally and although historical and current gauges are providing useful and frequent data in the developed world, the number of gauges in developing and emerging economies is very small and measurement stations are often very far apart and in remote locations thus making inference of processes and data collection difficult. Remote sensing, space-borne, and airborne can alleviate some of these limitations but has its own shortcomings. Hydrodynamic models can complement observations but the accuracy and complexity of the flood flow models used vary with both spatial scale at which they are applied and complexity of the topographic landscape. Furthermore, models are only as good as the data used to drive and calibrate them. In recent years, substantial efforts are being made to improve this complex situation of observing, mapping, and modeling flood processes, both in terms of flood model development and remote sensing, particularly satellite platforms. This chapter provides a detailed account of this complex interplay between models and data to observe, simulate, and understand flood processes on various scales and in different landscape settings.},

Here we show via annually resolved, Landsat-derived channel masks of the dynamic meandering Ucayali River in Peru that cutoffs act as perturbations that nonlocally accelerate river migration and drive channel widening both upstream and downstream of the cutoff locations. By tracking planform changes of individual meander bends near cutoffs, we find that the downstream distance of cutoff influence scales linearly with the length of the removed reach. The discovery of nonlocal cutoff influence supports the hypothesis of ``avalanche''-type behavior in meander cutoff dynamics and presents new challenges in modeling and prediction of rivers' self-adjusting responses to perturbations.},

In particular, deltas and braided river channel networks may contain thousands of links that route water, sediment, and nutrients across landscapes. In order to model flows through channel networks and characterize network structure, the direction of flow for each link within the network must be known. In this work, we propose a rapid, automatic, and objective method to identify flow directions for all links of a channel network using only remotely sensed imagery and knowledge of the network's inlet and outlet locations. We designed a suite of direction-predicting algorithms (DPAs), each of which exploits a particular morphologic characteristic of the channel network to provide a prediction of a link's flow direction. DPAs were chained together to create ``recipes'', or algorithms that set all the flow directions of a channel network. Separate recipes were built for deltas and braided rivers and applied to seven delta and two braided river channel networks. Across all nine channel networks, the recipe-predicted flow directions agreed with expert judgement for 97\&thinsp;\% of all tested links, and most disagreements were attributed to unusual channel network topologies that can easily be accounted for by pre-seeding critical links with known flow directions. Our results highlight the (non)universality of process\textendash form relationships across deltas and braided rivers.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In the past decade, as discharge of major rivers was identified as a suitable parameter to test the performance of the macro-scale land surface models, river-routing received significant attention, with development of multiple schemes. As resolution improves, the possibility of river-routing schemes connecting the global models with watershed issues has emerged as an option. Yet, even as results from these schemes become easily available, a comprehensive overview of their scope and limitation when considering regional or watershed-centric applications is lacking. To address this gap, 18 published river-routing schemes are compared by examining their structure, rationale and limitations. Due to the diverse nature of scheme implementations, a direct comparison of performance is not yet possible. However, features and studies geared towards watershed-scale applications are highlighted. Issues of global to local integration are discussed.},

Large ensemble size, along with reasonably high modeling resolution, allows one to efficiently sample natural climate variability and increase our ability to predict future changes in the hydrological extremes. It has been shown that the annual maximum river discharge can almost double by the mid-XXI century in the outlets of major Siberian rivers. In the western regions, there is a weak signal in the river discharge and flood hazard, hardly discernible above climate variability. Annual maximum flood area is projected to increase across Siberia mostly by 2\textendash 5\% relative to the baseline period. A contribution of natural climate variability at different temporal scales to the uncertainty of ensemble prediction is discussed. The analysis shows that there expected considerable changes in the extreme river discharge probability at locations of the key hydropower facilities. This suggests that the extensive impact studies are required to develop recommendations for maintaining regional energy security.},

  abstract = {We develop a permafrost classification system to describe the complex interaction of climatic and ecological processes in permafrost formation and degradation that differentiates five patterns of formation: lsquoclimate-drivenrsquo; lsquoclimate-driven, ecosystem-modifiedrsquo; lsquoclimate-driven, ecosystem-protectedrsquo; lsquoecosystem-drivenrsquo; and lsquoecosystem-protectedrsquo permafrost. Climate-driven permafrost develops in the continuous permafrost zone, where permafrost forms immediately after the surface is exposed to the atmosphere and even under shallow water. Climate-driven, ecosystem-modified permafrost occurs in the continuous permafrost zone when vegetation succession and organic-matter accumulation lead to development of an ice-rich layer at the top of the permafrost. During warming climates, permafrost that has formed as climate-driven can occur in the discontinuous permafrost zone, where it can persist for a long time as ecosystem-protected. Climate-driven, ecosystem protected permafrost, and its associated ground ice, cannot re-establish in the discontinuous zone once degraded, although the near surface can recover as ecosystem-driven permafrost. Ecosystem-driven permafrost forms in the discontinuous permafrost zone in poorly drained, low-lying and north-facing landscape conditions, and under strong ecosystem influence. Finally, ecosystem-protected permafrost persists as sporadic patches under warmer climates, but cannot be re-established after disturbance. These distinctions are important because the various types react differently to climate change and surface disturbances. For example, climate-driven, ecosystem-modified permafrost can experience thermokarst even under cold conditions because of its ice-rich layer formed during ecosystem development, and ecosystem-driven permafrost is unlikely to recover after disturbance, such as fire, if there is sufficient climate warming.

  abstract = {Hundreds of miles of streams in West Tennessee have been channelized or otherwise modified since the turn of century. After all or parts of a stream are straightened, dredged, or cleared, systematic hydrologic, geomorphic, and ecologic processes collectively begin to reduce energy conditions towards the premodified state. One hundred and five sites along 15 streams were studied in the Obion, Forked Deer, Hatchie, and Wolf River basins. All studied streams, except the Hatchie River, have had major channel modification along all or parts of their courses. Bank material shear-strength properties were determined through drained borehole-shear testing (168 tests) and used to interpret present critical bank conditions and factors of safety, and to estimate future channel-bank stability. Mean values of cohesive strength and angle of internal friction were 1.26 pounds per square inch and 30.1 degrees, respectively. Dendrogeomorphic analyses were made using botanical evidence of channel-bank failures to determine rates of channel widening; buried riparian stems were analyzed to determine rates of bank accretion. Channel bed-level changes through time and space were represented by a power equation. Plant ecological analyses were made to infer relative bank stability, to identify indicator species of the stage of bank recovery, and to determine patterns of vegetation development through the course of channel evolution. Quantitative data on morphologic changes were used with previously developed six-stage models of channel evolution and bank-slope development to estimate trends of geomorphic and ecologic processes and forms through time.},

  abstract = {The construction of Fort Peck Dam in the 1930s on the Missouri River, eastern Montana, initiated a series of changes in hydrologic conditions and channel morphology downstream from the dam that impacted channel stability. Impacts included streambed degradation of up to 3.6 m and substantially altered magnitude, frequency, and temporal distribution of flows. To investigate the effects of the altered flow regime and bed degradation on bank stability, two independent bank-stability analyses (one for planar failures, the other for rotational failures) were performed on 17 outside meanders. Both included the effects of matric suction and positive pore-water pressures, confining pressures, and layering. Instability occurred from the loss of matric suction and the generation of positive pore-water pressures. In this semiarid region, such hydrologic conditions are most likely to occur from the maintenance of moderate and high flows (greater than 425-566 m3/s) for extended periods (5-10 days or more), thereby providing a mechanism for saturation of the streambank. For the postdam period, average annual frequencies of flows maintained above 566 m3/s for 5- and 10-day durations are 149 and 257\% greater, respectively. The analyses indicated that 30\% of the sites were susceptible to planar failures while 53\% of the sites were susceptible to rotational failures under sustained moderate- and high-flow conditions, while under a worst-case rapid drawdown scenario. 80\% of the banks were susceptible to failure. Despite the negative effects of the altered flow regime, analysis of maps and aerial photographs shows that closure of Fort Peck Dam has resulted in a fourfold reduction of the average rate of long-term channel migration between the dam and the North Dakota border.},

Bank erosion delivered additional sediment to the channel, and transport energy was increased by an inferred increase in the component of toal boundary shear stress affecting grains on the bed. Increased transport following debris removal in May 1987 continued throughout the entire autumn storm season through late November 1987, indicating persistent adjustment of the stream bed and banks despite marked response to earlier flows as large as bankfull. Stream bed adjustments included development of a semi-regular sequence of alternate bars and pools, many of which were spaced independently of former pool locations. -from Authors},

However, numerical studies of how projected geophysical changes in sea ice will realistically impact ship navigation are lacking. To address this deficiency, we analyze seven climate model projections of sea ice properties, assuming two different climate change scenarios [representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5] and two vessel classes, to assess future changes in peak season (September) Arctic shipping potential. By midcentury, changing sea ice conditions enable expanded September navigability for common open-water ships crossing the Arctic along the Northern Sea Route over the Russian Federation, robust new routes for moderately ice-strengthened (Polar Class 6) ships over the North Pole, and new routes through the Northwest Passage for both vessel classes. Although numerous other nonclimatic factors also limit Arctic shipping potential, these findings have important economic, strategic, environmental, and governance implications for the region.},

Streamflow is of particular interest in the Colorado River Basin (CRB) due to the region's rapidly growing population, projected temperature increases that are expected to be higher than elsewhere in the contiguous United States, and subsequent climate-driven disturbances including drought, vegetation mortality, and wildfire, which makes the region more vulnerable to changes in hydrologic extremes. Here, we determine how streamflow extremes have shifted in the CRB using two statistical methods\textemdash the Mann-Kendall trend detection analysis and Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) theorem. We evaluate these changes in the context of key flow metrics that include high and low flow percentiles, maximum and minimum 7-day flows, and the center timing of streamflow using historical gage records representative of natural flows. Monthly results indicate declines of up to 41\% for high and low flows during the June to July peak runoff season, while increases of up to 24\% were observed earlier from March to April. Our results highlight a key threshold elevation and latitude of 2300m and 39\textdegree{} North, respectively, where there is a distinct shift in the trend. The spatiotemporal patterns observed are indicative of changing snowmelt patterns as a primary cause of the shifts. Identification of how this change varies spatially has consequences for improved land management strategies, as specific regions most vulnerable to threats can be prioritized for mitigation or adaptation as the climate warms.},

Three formulas for estimating parameters of wide rectangular, triangular, and parabolic cross sections are proposed. The influence of the flood on channel flow routing parameters is taken into account. The HEC-HMS hydrological model and the geospatial hydrologic analysis module HEC-GeoHMS were used to extract channel or watershed characteristics and to divide sub-basins. In addition, the initial and constant-rate method, user synthetic unit hydrograph method, and exponential recession method were used to estimate runoff volumes, the direct runoff hydrograph, and the baseflow hydrograph, respectively. The Muskingum model with variable parameters was then applied in the Louzigou Basin in Henan Province of China, and of the results, the percentages of flood events with a relative error of peak discharge less than 20\% and runoff volume less than 10\% are both 100\%. They also show that the percentages of flood events with coefficients of determination greater than 0.8 are 83.33\%, 91.67\%, and 87.5\%, respectively, for rectangular, triangular, and parabolic cross sections in 24 flood events.

  abstract = {Understanding of the relative contribution of bank erosion to sediment budgets in New Zealand is limited. Few measurements of bank erosion rates exist, and this is a major limitation to the development of a locally calibrated model of bank erosion. The New Zealand sediment budget model, SedNetNZ, predicts bank erosion based on preliminary data, and this study aims to underpin the development of an improved model for bank erosion. Photogrammetric techniques and LiDAR were used to collect data on bank erosion rates for five different river reaches, ranging from 3 to 14 km in length, in the Kaipara Catchment, Northland, New Zealand. Changing river channel planform between the 1950s and 2015 was assessed using four to five well-spaced dates of historical aerial photographs. Changes in planform were combined with bank height, to calculate erosion and accretion volumes which were compared with SedNetNZ modelled estimates. Erosion and accretion is relatively evenly balanced in the study sites. The largest difference in terms of relative proportions of erosion and accretion are found along the Tangowahine River (13.4 km reach length), where 492,000 m3of sediment eroded between 1956 and 2015 compared to 364,000 m3of accretion. Lateral migration rates (erosion) for the five river reaches range between 0.14 m yr- 1and 0.21 m yr- 1and are comparable with those measured by previous assessments in New Zealand. The migration rates in channel widths per year for the three larger rivers (stream order 5\textendash 6) range between 0.4\% and 0.8\% of channel width per year. In contrast, the smaller streams (stream order 3\textendash 4) are retreating more rapidly, with width-averaged rates of 1.7\% and 3.0\%. Current SedNetNZ modelling tends to underestimate the bank height and greatly overestimates the migration rate.},

  abstract = {Crossing the boundaries in global sustainability The planetary boundary (PB) concept, introduced in 2009, aimed to define the environmental limits within which humanity can safely operate. This approach has proved influential in global sustainability policy development. Steffen et al. provide an updated and extended analysis of the PB framework. Of the original nine proposed boundaries, they identify three (including climate change) that might push the Earth system into a new state if crossed and that also have a pervasive influence on the remaining boundaries. They also develop the PB framework so that it can be applied usefully in a regional context. Science, this issue 10.1126/science.1259855 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTION There is an urgent need for a new paradigm that integrates the continued development of human societies and the maintenance of the Earth system (ES) in a resilient and accommodating state. The planetary boundary (PB) framework contributes to such a paradigm by providing a science-based analysis of the risk that human perturbations will destabilize the ES at the planetary scale. Here, the scientific underpinnings of the PB framework are updated and strengthened. RATIONALE The relatively stable, 11,700-year-long Holocene epoch is the only state of the ES that we know for certain can support contemporary human societies. There is increasing evidence that human activities are affecting ES functioning to a degree that threatens the resilience of the ES\textemdash its ability to persist in a Holocene-like state in the face of increasing human pressures and shocks. The PB framework is based on critical processes that regulate ES functioning. By combining improved scientific understanding of ES functioning with the precautionary principle, the PB framework identifies levels of anthropogenic perturbations below which the risk of destabilization of the ES is likely to remain low\textemdash a ``safe operating space'' for global societal development. A zone of uncertainty for each PB highlights the area of increasing risk. The current level of anthropogenic impact on the ES, and thus the risk to the stability of the ES, is assessed by comparison with the proposed PB (see the figure). RESULTS Three of the PBs (climate change, stratospheric ozone depletion, and ocean acidification) remain essentially unchanged from the earlier analysis. Regional-level boundaries as well as globally aggregated PBs have now been developed for biosphere integrity (earlier ``biodiversity loss''), biogeochemical flows, land-system change, and freshwater use. At present, only one regional boundary (south Asian monsoon) can be established for atmospheric aerosol loading. Although we cannot identify a single PB for novel entities (here defined as new substances, new forms of existing substances, and modified life forms that have the potential for unwanted geophysical and/or biological effects), they are included in the PB framework, given their potential to change the state of the ES. Two of the PBs\textemdash climate change and biosphere integrity\textemdash are recognized as ``core'' PBs based on their fundamental importance for the ES. The climate system is a manifestation of the amount, distribution, and net balance of energy at Earth's surface; the biosphere regulates material and energy flows in the ES and increases its resilience to abrupt and gradual change. Anthropogenic perturbation levels of four of the ES processes/features (climate change, biosphere integrity, biogeochemical flows, and land-system change) exceed the proposed PB (see the figure). CONCLUSIONS PBs are scientifically based levels of human perturbation of the ES beyond which ES functioning may be substantially altered. Transgression of the PBs thus creates substantial risk of destabilizing the Holocene state of the ES in which modern societies have evolved. The PB framework does not dictate how societies should develop. These are political decisions that must include consideration of the human dimensions, including equity, not incorporated in the PB framework. Nevertheless, by identifying a safe operating space for humanity on Earth, the PB framework can make a valuable contribution to decision-makers in charting desirable courses for societal development. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/347/6223/1259855/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Current status of the control variables for seven of the planetary boundaries. The green zone is the safe operating space, the yellow represents the zone of uncertainty (increasing risk), and the red is a high-risk zone. The planetary boundary itself lies at the intersection of the green and yellow zones. The control variables have been normalized for the zone of uncertainty; the center of the figure therefore does not represent values of 0 for the control variables. The control variable shown for climate change is atmospheric CO2 concentration. Processes for which global-level boundaries cannot yet be quantified are represented by gray wedges; these are atmospheric aerosol loading, novel entities, and the functional role of biosphere integrity. The planetary boundaries framework defines a safe operating space for humanity based on the intrinsic biophysical processes that regulate the stability of the Earth system. Here, we revise and update the planetary boundary framework, with a focus on the underpinning biophysical science, based on targeted input from expert research communities and on more general scientific advances over the past 5 years. Several of the boundaries now have a two-tier approach, reflecting the importance of cross-scale interactions and the regional-level heterogeneity of the processes that underpin the boundaries. Two core boundaries\textemdash climate change and biosphere integrity\textemdash have been identified, each of which has the potential on its own to drive the Earth system into a new state should they be substantially and persistently transgressed. Developments in the planetary boundaries concept provide a framework to support global sustainability.

  abstract = {Stream bank erosion rates measured over a two-year period on a moorland and a forested stream in the Institute of Hydrologys Balquhidder Paired Catchments in central Scotland were compared. Bank erosion rates are generally higher on the mainstream of the moorland catchment and highest in winter on both streams. Bank erosion is correlated with the incidence of frost: minimum temperatures measured on scream banks of the forested stream were an average of 3.7\textdegree C higher than on stream banks both outside the forest and on the moorland stream. This makes the incidence of frost on forested stream banks half as frequent. Volumes of material eroded from the mainstreams were combined with bulk density measurements and it is estimated that erosion of the mainstream banks is contributing 1.5 and 7.3 per cent of the sediment yield of the forested and moorland catchments, respectively. Analysis of the vertical distribution of erosion on the banks of both streams suggests an undercutting mechanism which is more pronounced in the moorland stream. The influence of trees on bank erosion and possible implications for the management of forest streams are discussed. \textcopyright{} 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Salt marshes are deemed as one of the most dynamic and valuable ecosystems on Earth. Recently, salt marsh deterioration and loss have become widespread because of anthropogenic stressors and sea level rise. Long-term acquisition of spatial information on salt marsh vegetation communities is thus critical to detect the general evolutionary trend of marsh ecosystems before irreversible change occurs. Medium resolution imagery organized in inter-annual time series has been proven suitable for large-scale mapping of salt marsh vegetation. For long-term monitoring purpose, the challenge still lies in developing time series based on data with sparse and uneven temporal distribution. This paper proposes a flexible Monthly NDVI Time-Series (MNTS) approach to achieve multi-temporal classification maps of salt marsh vegetation communities in the Virginia Coast Reserve, USA, by utilizing all viable Landsat TM/ETM~+~images during the period 1984\textendash 2011. Salt marsh vegetation communities are identified on a reference MNTS spanning 12 months with an overall accuracy of 0.898, approximately 0.107 higher than classifications using single images. Utilizing a flexible selection process based on the reference MNTS, a significant inverse hyperbolic relationship emerges between overall accuracy and average length of the time series. Based on these results, eight classification maps with average accuracy of 0.844 and time interval of 2\textendash 5 years are acquired. A spatio-temporal analysis of the maps indicates that the upper low marsh vegetation community has diminished by 19.4\% in the study period, with a recent acceleration of losses. The conversion of marsh area to vegetation communities typical of low elevations (37.7~km2) is more than twice the conversion to vegetation communities typical of high elevations (18.3 km2), suggesting that salt marsh ecosystems at the Virginia Coast Reserve are affected by sea level rise.},

Over 100 billion metric tons of sediment and 1 to 3 billion metric tons of carbon are now sequestered in reservoirs constructed largely within the past 50 years. African and Asian rivers carry a greatly reduced sediment load; Indonesian rivers deliver much more sediment to coastal areas.

Its application, however, poses many methodical questions, and throughout the literature numerous solutions have been sought. The quantification of the recession curve involves the selection of an analytical expression, derivation of a characteristic recession and optimization of the recession parameters. A major problem is the high variability encountered in the recession behaviour of individual segments. The segments represent different stages in the outflow process, and a physically based short-term or seasonal influence on the recession rate adds to the problem of deriving a characteristic recession. This paper discusses these elements of recession analysis and reviews different ways of characterizing the baseflow recession rate.},

Our study shows that the anomalously low DIN/DIP ratios are caused by sedimentary denitrification. The estimated sedimentary denitrification rates, ranging from 0.7 to 1.5mmol/m2/day, are similar to values previously reported for continental shelf regions. An annual rate of sedimentary denitrification in the Bering Sea shelf can be, at a low limit, in the order of 2.5Tg N/yr. This corresponds to roughly one-third of the annual net supply of the nitrate to the Bering Sea shelf and, at least, 2.5\% of annual global denitrification rate in oceanic sediments, implying that the sedimentary denitrification in the Bering Sea shelf could be a significant sink of nitrogen in both regional and global scales.},

The Routing Application for Parallel computatIon of Discharge (RAPID) was applied to the MRB with more than 1.2 million river reaches for a 10-year study (2005-2014). Runoff data from the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model was used as input to RAPID. This article investigates the effect of topography on RAPID performance, the differences between the VIC-RAPID streamflow simulations in the HUC-2 regions of the MRB, and the impact of major dams on the streamflow simulations. The model performance improved when initial parameter values, especially the Muskingum K parameter, were estimated by taking topography into account. The statistical summary indicates the RAPID model performs better in the Ohio and Tennessee Regions and the Upper and Lower Mississippi River Regions in comparison to the western part of the MRB, due to the better performance of the VIC model. The model accuracy also increases when lakes and reservoirs are considered in the modeling framework. In general, results show the VIC-RAPID streamflow simulation is satisfactory at the continental scale of the MRB.},

Researchers worldwide are analyzing the model output and will produce results likely to underlie the forthcoming Fifth Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Unprecedented in scale and attracting interest from all major climate modeling groups, CMIP5 includes ``long term'' simulations of twentieth-century climate and projections for the twenty-first century and beyond. Conventional atmosphere\textendash ocean global climate models and Earth system models of intermediate complexity are for the first time being joined by more recently developed Earth system models under an experiment design that allows both types of models to be compared to observations on an equal footing. Besides the longterm experiments, CMIP5 calls for an entirely new suite of ``near term'' simulations focusing on recent decades and the future to year 2035. These ``decadal predictions'' are initialized based on observations and will be used to explore the predictability of climate and to assess the forecast system's predictive skill. The CMIP5 experiment design also allows for participation of stand-alone atmospheric models and includes a variety of idealized experiments that will improve understanding of the range of model responses found in the more complex and realistic simulations. An exceptionally comprehensive set of model output is being collected and made freely available to researchers through an integrated but distributed data archive.

Despite their importance, quantitative frameworks for their analysis lack behind those available for tributary networks. In a companion paper, delta channel networks were conceptualized as directed graphs and spectral graph theory was used to design a quantitative framework for exploring delta connectivity and flux dynamics. Here we use this framework to introduce a suite of graph-theoretic and entropy-based metrics, to quantify two components of a delta's complexity: (1) Topologic, imposed by the network connectivity and (2) Dynamic, dictated by the flux partitioning and distribution. The metrics are aimed to facilitate comparing, contrasting, and establishing connections between deltaic structure, process, and form. We illustrate the proposed analysis using seven deltas in diverse morphodynamic environments and of various degrees of channel complexity. By projecting deltas into a topo-dynamic space whose coordinates are given by topologic and dynamic delta complexity metrics, we show that this space provides a basis for delta comparison and physical insight into their dynamic behavior. The examined metrics are demonstrated to relate to the intuitive notion of vulnerability, measured by the impact of upstream flux changes to the shoreline flux, and reveal that complexity and vulnerability are inversely related. Finally, a spatially explicit metric, akin to a delta width function, is introduced to classify shapes of different delta types.},

The natural balance of material and energy fluxes, which maintains a stable hydrologic, geomorphologic, and ecological state of a river delta, is often disrupted by external perturbations causing topological and dynamical changes in the delta structure and function. A formal quantitative framework for studying delta channel network connectivity and transport dynamics and their response to change is lacking. Here we present such a framework based on spectral graph theory and demonstrate its value in computing delta's steady state fluxes and identifying upstream (contributing) and downstream (nourishment) areas and fluxes from any point in the network. We use this framework to construct vulnerability maps that quantify the relative change of sediment and water delivery to the shoreline outlets in response to possible perturbations in hundreds of upstream links. The framework is applied to the Wax Lake delta in the Louisiana coast of the U.S. and the Niger delta in West Africa. In a companion paper, we present a comprehensive suite of metrics that quantify topologic and dynamic complexity of delta channel networks and, via application to seven deltas in diverse environments, demonstrate their potential to reveal delta morphodynamics and relate to notions of vulnerability and robustness.},

  abstract = {The form and function of river deltas is intricately linked to the evolving structure of their channel networks, which controls how effectively deltas are nourished with sediments and nutrients. Understanding the coevolution of deltaic channels and their flux organization is crucial for guiding maintenance strategies of these highly stressed systems from a range of anthropogenic activities. To date, however, a unified theory explaining how deltas self-organize to distribute water and sediment up to the shoreline remains elusive. Here, we provide evidence for an optimality principle underlying the self-organized partition of fluxes in delta channel networks. By introducing a suitable nonlocal entropy rate (nERnER{$<$}mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"{$><$}mml:mrow{$><$}mml:mi{$>$}n{$<$}/mml:mi{$><$}mml:mi{$>$}E{$<$}/mml:mi{$><$}mml:mi{$>$}R{$<$}/mml:mi{$><$}/mml:mrow{$><$}/mml:math{$>$}) and by analyzing field and simulated deltas, we suggest that delta networks achieve configurations that maximize the diversity of water and sediment flux delivery to the shoreline. We thus suggest that prograding deltas attain dynamically accessible optima of flux distributions on their channel network topologies, thus effectively decoupling evolutionary time scales of geomorphology and hydrology. When interpreted in terms of delta resilience, high nER configurations reflect an increased ability to withstand perturbations. However, the distributive mechanism responsible for both diversifying flux delivery to the shoreline and dampening possible perturbations might lead to catastrophic events when those perturbations exceed certain intensity thresholds.},

In the Arctic Ocean, fetch varies seasonally from essentially zero in winter to hundreds of kilometers in recent summers. Using in situ observations of waves in the central Beaufort Sea, combined with a numerical wave model and satellite sea ice observations, we show that wave energy scales with fetch throughout the seasonal ice cycle. Furthermore, we show that the increased open water of 2012 allowed waves to develop beyond pure wind seas and evolve into swells. The swells remain tied to the available fetch, however, because fetch is a proxy for the basin size in which the wave evolution occurs. Thus, both sea and swell depend on the open water fetch in the Arctic, because the swell is regionally driven. This suggests that further reductions in seasonal ice cover in the future will result in larger waves, which in turn provide a mechanism to break up sea ice and accelerate ice retreat.},

Many of the analyses have focused on using and improving forecast models. Summarizing and synthesizing the results from a series of separate papers, the overall view is of an Arctic shifting to a more seasonal system. The dramatic increase in open water extent and duration in the autumn means that large surface waves and significant surface heat fluxes are now common. When refreezing finally does occur, it is a highly variable process in space and time. Wind and wave events drive episodic advances and retreats of the ice edge, with associated variations in sea ice formation types (e.g., pancakes, nilas). This variability becomes imprinted on the winter ice cover, which in turn affects the melt season the following year.},

  abstract = {Six Ice-Tethered Profilers (ITP), deployed in the central Canada Basin of the Arctic Ocean between 2004 and 2007, have provided detailed potential temperature and salinity measurements of a double-diffusive staircase at about 200\textendash 300 m depth. Individual layers in the staircase are of order 1 m in vertical height but appear to extend horizontally for hundreds of kilometers, with along-layer gradients of temperature and salinity tightly related. On the basis of laboratory-derived double-diffusive flux laws, estimated vertical heat fluxes through the staircase are in the range 0.05\textendash 0.3 W m-2, only about one tenth of the estimated mean surface mixed layer heat flux to the sea ice. It is thus concluded that the vertical transport of heat from the Atlantic Water in the central basin is unlikely to have a significant impact to the Canada Basin ocean surface heat budget. Icebreaker conductivity-temperature-depth data from the Beaufort Gyre Freshwater Experiment show that the staircase is absent at the basin periphery. Turbulent mixing that presumably disrupts the staircase might drive greater flux from the Atlantic Water at the basin boundaries and possibly dominate the regionally averaged heat flux.},

  abstract = {The Arctic halocline stratification is an important barrier to the transport of deep ocean heat to the underside of sea ice. Surface water in the Chukchi Sea, warmed in summer by solar radiation, ventilates the Canada Basin halocline to create a warm layer below the mixed-layer base. The year-round persistence of this layer is shown to be consistent with the seasonal cycle of halocline ventilation. We present hydrographic observations and model results to show how Chukchi Sea density outcrops migrate seasonally as surface fluxes modify salinity and temperature. This migration is such that in winter, isopycnals bounding the warm halocline are blocked from ventilation, while the cool, relatively salty and deeper halocline layers are ventilated. In this way, the warm halocline is isolated by stratification (both vertically and laterally) each winter. Results shed light on the fate and impact to sea ice of the warm halocline under future freshening and warming of the surface Arctic Ocean.},

Field observations suggest that cattle are important agents in causing streambanks to erode, but so many variables are involved that it is difficult to isolate the role of cattle. Instead, an empirical approach based on long-term controlled experiment was adopted along a small perennial stream in the Central Basin of Tennessee. The results showed that uncontrolled grazing caused about six times as much gross bank erosion as occurred on the protected control stretch. However, most of this difference was due to breakdown of banks by trampling and consequent erosion, rather than by bank scour caused by removal of bank vegetation by grazing. That is, bank vegetation alone did not appear to be a primary control. A relatively inexpensive grade-control structure reduced the gross bank erosion by about 50 per cent. The rapid destruction of streambanks observed in this study suggests that reduction of geomorphic resistance by uncontrolled stock access to streambanks has been an important factor in the stream widening that has taken place during historical time in the eastern United States.},

  abstract = {Seasonally continuous long-term information on surface water and flooding extent over subcontinental scales is critical for quantifying spatiotemporal changes in surface water dynamics. We used seasonally continuous Landsat TM/ETM+ data and generic random forest-based models to synoptically map the extent and dynamics of surface water and flooding (1986\textendash 2011) over the Murray\textendash Darling Basin (MDB). The MDB is a large semi-arid basin with competing demands for water that has recently experienced one of the most severe droughts in the southeast of Australia. We used a stratified random probability sampling design with 500 sample pixels each observed across time to assess the accuracy of the surface water maps. We further developed models to map flooded forest at a riparian site that experienced severe tree dieback. Water indices and bands 5 and 6 were among the top 10 explanatory variables most important for mapping surface water. Surface water extent per season per year showed high inter-annual and seasonal variability, with low extent and variability during the Millennium Drought (1999\textendash 2009). Accuracy assessment yielded an overall classification accuracy of 99.9\% ({$\pm$}0.02\% standard error) with 87\% ({$\pm$}3\%) and 96\% ({$\pm$}2\%) producer's and user's accuracy of water, respectively. User's and producer's accuracies of water were higher for Landsat 7 than Landsat 5 data. Both producer's and user's accuracies of water were lower in wet years compared to dry years. The approach presented here can be further developed for global application and is relevant to areas with competing water demands. Quantifying the uncertainty of the accuracy assessment and providing an unbiased accuracy estimate are imperative steps when remotely sensed products are intended to be used for follow on applications.},

  abstract = {Shoal margin collapses of several million cubic meters have occurred in the Western Scheldt estuary, the Netherlands, on average five times a year over the last decades. While these collapses involve significant volumes of material, their effect on the channel-shoal morphology is unknown. We hypothesize that collapses dynamicize the channel-shoal interactions, which could impact the ecological functioning, flood safety, and navigation in the estuary. The objective is to investigate how locations, probability, type, and volume of shoal margin collapse affect the channel-shoal dynamics. We implemented an empirically validated parameterization for shoal margin collapses and tested its effect on simulated estuary morphological development in a Delft3D schematization of the Western Scheldt. Three sets of scenarios were analyzed for near-field and far-field effects on flow pattern and channel-shoal morphology: (1) an observed shoal margin collapse of 2014, (2) initial large collapses on 10 locations, and (3) continuous collapses predicted by our novel probabilistic model over a time span of decades. Results show that a single shoal margin collapse only affects the local dynamics in the longitudinal flow direction and dampen out within a year for typical volumes, whereas larger disturbances that reach the seaward or landward sill at tidal channel junctions grow. The direction of the strongest tidally averaged flow determined the redistribution of the collapsed sediment. We conclude that adding the process of shoal margin collapses increases the channel-shoal interactions and that in intensively dredged estuaries shoal margins oversteepen, amplifying the number of collapses, but because of dredging the natural morphological response is interrupted.},

  abstract = {The Colorado River is the primary water source for more than 30 million people in the United States and Mexico. Recent studies that project streamf low changes in the Colorado River all project annual declines, but the magnitude of the projected decreases range from less than 10\% to 45\% by the mid-twenty-first century. To understand these differences, we address the questions the management community has raised: Why is there such a wide range of projections of impacts of future climate change on Colorado River streamflow, and how should this uncertainty be interpreted? We identify four major sources of disparities among studies that arise from both methodological and model differences. In order of importance, these are differences in 1) the global climate models (GCMs) and emission scenarios used; 2) the ability of land surface and atmospheric models to simulate properly the high-elevation runoff source areas; 3) the sensitivities of land surface hydrology models to precipitation and temperature changes; and 4) the methods used to statistically downscale GCM scenarios. In accounting for these differences, there is substantial evidence across studies that future Colorado River streamflow will be reduced under the current trajectories of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions because of a combination of strong temperature-induced runoff curtailment and reduced annual precipitation. Reconstructions of preinstrumental streamflows provide additional insights; the greatest risk to Colorado River streamf lows is a multidecadal drought, like that observed in paleoreconstructions, exacerbated by a steady reduction in flows due to climate change. This could result in decades of sustained streamflows much lower than have been observed in the \textasciitilde 100 years of instrumental record.},

  abstract = {Hydrograph recession constants are required in rainfall-runoff models, baseflow augmentation studies, geohydrologic investigations and in regional low-flow studies. The recession portion of a streamflow hydrograph is shown to be either an autoregressive process or an integrated moving average process, depending upon the structure of the assumed model errors. Six different estimators of the baseflow recession constant are derived and tested using thousands of hydrograph recessions available at twenty-three sites in Massachusetts, U.S. When hydrograph recessions are treated as an autoregressive process, unconditional least squares or maximum likelihood estimators of the baseflow recession constant are shown to exhibit significant downward bias due to the short lengths of hydrograph recessions. The precision of estimated of hydrograph recession constants is shown to depend heavily upon assumptions regarding the structure of the model errors. In general, regression procedures for estimating hydrograph recession parameters are generally preferred to the time-series alternatives. An evaluation of the physical significance of estimates of the baseflow recession constant is provided by comparing regional regression models which relate low-flow statistics to three independent variables: drainage area, basin slope and the baseflow recession constant. As anticipated, approximately unbiased estimators of the baseflow recession constant provide significant information regarding the geohydrologic response of watersheds.},

To characterize variability in lake extents, we analyzed summertime lake area loss (i.e., shrinkage) on two deltas over the past 20 years, using Landsat-derived water masks. We find that monthly shrinkage rates have a pronounced structured variability around the channel network with the shrinkage rate systematically decreasing farther away from the channels. This pattern of shrinkage is predominantly attributed to a deeper active layer enhancing near-surface connectivity and storage and greater vegetation density closer to the channels leading to increased evapotranspiration rates. This shrinkage signal, easily extracted from remote sensing observations, may offer the means to constrain estimates of lacustrine methane emissions and to develop process-based estimates of depth to permafrost on arctic deltas.},

The timing and style of fluvial processes in the earth's permafrost regions differ from those occurring in midlatitude settings. Moreover, in comparison to temperate-zone systems, rivers located entirely within permafrost perform most of their work during relatively short periods of time. This paper examines river ice hydrology and the resulting geomorphic processes that occur within the Colville delta, Alaska. Fluvial processes and landform development within the Colville delta occur after the flood-pulse is initiated by the breakup of river ice. During this 4-month period, the geomorphic processes are largely influenced by the movement of ice. The flood-pulse and accompanying river ice influences erosional and depositional processes and results in unique styles of sediment transport, deposition, and riverbank erosion.},

  abstract = {Large uncertainties in the budget of atmospheric methane, an important greenhouse gas, limit the accuracy of climate change projections1,2. Thaw lakes in North Siberia are known to emit methane3, but the magnitude of these emissions remains uncertain because most methane is released through ebullition (bubbling), which is spatially and temporally variable.Here we report a new method of measuring ebullition and use it to quantify methane emissions from two thaw lakes in North Siberia. We show that ebullition accounts for 95 per cent of methane emissions from these lakes, and that methane flux from thaw lakes in our study region may be five times higher than previously estimated3. Extrapolation of these fluxes indicates that thaw lakes in North Siberia emit 3.8 teragrams of methane per year, which increases present estimates of methane emissions from northern wetlands (6,\"A\`i40 teragrams per year; refs 1, 2, 4,\"A\`i6) by between 10 and 63 per cent. We find that thawing permafrost along lake margins accounts for most of the methane released from the lakes, and estimate that an expansion of thaw lakes between 1974 and 2000, which was concurrent with regional warming, increased methane emissions in our study region by 58 per cent. Furthermore, the Pleistocene age (35,260,\"A\`i42,900 years) of methane emitted from hotspots along thawing lake margins indicates that this positive feedback to climate warming has led to the release of old carbon stocks previously stored in permafrost.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing algorithms for retrieval of Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) were generally developed for deep ocean waters while practical applications of SSS are commonly involved in coastal (particularly nearshore) waters. To fill the gap, this paper presents a new SSS algorithm, called Nearshore SSS Algorithm, developed using the Artificial Neural Networks toolbox in the MATLAB Program and 7 years of cloud-free Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua data as well as in situ data collected from United States Geological Survey (USGS) stations along the Northern Gulf of Mexico coast. The independent input variables involved in the new algorithm include the water-leaving reflectance at 412 nm, 443 nm, 488 nm, 555 nm, 678 nm, and 645 nm of MODIS Aqua sensor. Results of sensitivity analysis indicate that SSS in nearshore waters is most sensitive to reflectance at 412 nm and 488 nm, followed by the reflectance at 555 nm and 645 nm. While reflectance at 678 nm is also important, reflectance at 443 nm is the least important to SSS in nearshore waters, providing new insights into SSS in coastal waters. MODIS data collected from January 2012 to September 2014 were used for validation of the nearshore SSS algorithm. The linear correlation coefficient of this algorithm for Louisiana coast was 0.7256 and 0.6985 for the development and validation, respectively. A unique feature of this paper is that while the new algorithm is particularly useful to the retrieval of SSS in nearshore waters, it is also expanded to further offshore waters, providing reliable SSS data for various applications of coastal environment and resources management particularly along the northern Gulf of Mexico coast.},

  abstract = {Due to the tremendous flux of terrestrial nutrients from the Changjiang River, the waters in the coastal regions of the East China Sea (ECS) are exposed to heavy eutrophication. Satellite remote sensing was proven to be an ideal way of monitoring the spatiotemporal variability of these nutrients. In this study, satellite retrieval models for nitrate and phosphate concentrations in the coastal regions of the ECS are proposed using the back-propagation neural network (BP-NN). Both the satellite-retrieved sea surface salinity (SSS) and remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs) were used as inputs in our model. Compared with models that only use Rrs or SSS, the newly proposed model performs much better in the study area, with determination coefficients (R2) of 0.98 and 0.83, and mean relative error (MRE) values of 18.2\% and 17.2\% for nitrate and phosphate concentrations, respectively. Based on the proposed model and satellite-retrieved Rrs and SSS datasets, monthly time-series maps of nitrate and phosphate concentrations in the coastal regions of the ECS for 2015\&ndash;2017 were retrieved for the first time. The results show that the distribution of nutrients had a significant seasonal variation. Phosphate concentrations in the ECS were lower in spring and summer than those in autumn and winter, which was mainly due to phytoplankton uptake and utilization. However, nitrate still spread far out into the ocean in summer because the diluted Changjiang River water remained rich in nitrogen.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} The water levels of lakes along the eastern route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project (ER-SNWDP) are expected to rise significantly and subsequently affect the processes of flood control and drainage in corresponding lake basins. However, few studies have focused on the impacts of inter-basin water diversion on the flood control and drainage of water-receiving areas at the lake basin scale. Using MIKE software, this paper builds a coupled hydrodynamic model to address the existing literature gap regarding the impacts of inter-basin water diversion on the processes of flood control and drainage in a water-receiving lake basin, and it considers the many types of hydraulic structures in the model. First, a flood simulation model was constructed to simulate the complex movement of water transferred by the ER-SNWDP, by waterlogging in the lakeside area around Nansi Lake (NL), and water in NL and its tributaries. The ER-SNWDP was also considered in the model. Second, the model was calibrated and verified with measurement data, and the results showed that the model was efficient and presented a Nash\textendash Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) between 0.65 and 0.99. Third, the processes of flooding and draining in the lakeside area of NL were simulated under different water diversion and precipitation values. Finally, the impacts of the emergency operations of the ER-SNWDP on flood control and waterlogging drainage in the lakeside area of NL were analysed based on the results from the proposed model, and some implications are presented for the integrated management of inter-basin water diversion and affected lakes.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

More than 9,000 willow (Salix nigra) posts were emplaced in February 1994 by the U.S. Army, Corps of Engineers in an effort to stabilize eroding stream banks using an experimental bioengi-neering technique. Monitoring of this stream reach and the willow post bank stabilization has resulted in a data base to assess willow mortality as related to bank aspect, post diameter, cover, and base elevation above low water. Monitoring has also resulted in the development of revised construction guidelines. Survivability of the posts, a necessary condition for long-term success, was found to average 81 percent in May 1994, 43 percent in October 1994, and 41 percent in August 1995. Even with survivability as low as 29 percent to 34 percent at specific bend reaches, willow posts are documented to be successful in bank stabilization for the period of monitoring, in comparison with more traditional riprap stabilization methods. Guidelines for improved survivability and recommended site selection are presented. Cost of willow post bank stabilization is less than traditional riprap, and willow posts can be emplaced using readily available equipment and materials.},

The temperature at the glacier bed is at the pressure melting point while the exposed rock surface (above the glacier) is subject to atmospheric conditions. At our study site, a north-facing rock wall at Konkordiaplatz, the surface temperatures have cooled below the freezing point during glacier retreat. Sensitivity studies on the thermal evolution and the permafrost dynamics in the bedrock involve heat transfer models with changing glacier surface and rock surface temperatures. They indicate that even small amounts of moisture limit the permafrost dynamics to the surface decametres at secular time scale. The calculations further indicate that, in the investigated rock wall, permafrost is penetrating as a consequence of the glacier retreat. The delay of the response of the permafrost base is in the order of millennia. Freezing and thawing of rock moisture leads to frost damage. The model results predict areas of frost shattering in the surface decametres and in the region of the permafrost base. The frost action is also favoured by unloading during glacier recession. {$\lnot$}\textcopyright{} 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {The shape and depth of thaw lake basins depends on lake age, on whether the talik (thaw bulb) is at steady state, and on the distribution of ice in the ground. To investigate implications of this broad hypothesis, we use a numerical model of conductive heat transfer, phase change, and thaw subsidence of ice-rich sediment beneath a lake in cross section. For ground thermal properties with lake temperatures and dimensions consistent with measurements, modeled talik depth approximately increases with \$\textbackslash backslashsqrt\{\textbackslash backslashrm time\}\$ except in lakes in deep ground ice which deepen more rapidly because of consolidation on thawing. In deep ground ice environments, basins achieve depths of {$\surd\cent$},\"A{$\infty$}\`A\"U20 m in {$\surd\cent$},\"A{$\infty$}\`A\"U5 ka. Expanding lakes with disequilibrium taliks have deep basins with broad, 100+ m wide, inclined margins. In shallow ground ice settings (either original epigenetic ice or in permafrost that has reformed in drained basins), lakes are \textbackslash textless3 m deep and flat bottomed. Unaffected by preexisting topography and ground ice variations, first-generation lakes in deep ground ice are rounder and grow larger in area than later-generation lakes. These predictions are consistent with GPS, sonar, and remote sensing measurements of bathymetry and plan view shape of first- and later-generation lakes in substrates with deep syngenetic ground ice (Pleistocene loess, northern Seward Peninsula, Alaska) and shallow epigenetic ice (Yukon Arctic coastal plain).},

  abstract = {Abstract: Water resources are limited in many areas of the North Slope, Alaska, particularly during winter. Water is used by the oil industry for ice road construction and maintenance, drilling and facility operations, and potable water supplies. The coastal plain between Teshekpuk Lake, in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A) and the Colville River has numerous shallow lakes, but further south in the northern foothills of the Brooks Range, and east to the Canning River, lakes are fewer. While many oil and gas lease sales have been conducted, or are proposed, access to the leases may be limited because of the lack of available water for ice road construction. Ice roads are the main means by which exploration is conducted in the Arctic, putting a stress on freshwater bodies that do not freeze to the lakebed in winter. Lakes that do not freeze to the lakebed also serve as overwintering habitat for fish. The purpose of this paper is to report on the potential distribution of water bodies that may provide overwinter water in selected areas from Teshekpuk Lake to the Canning River. The project used synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery to search for the presence of water in lakes in March 2006. In the Kuparuk and Canning SAR images, 52 and 61\% of lakes were frozen to their beds by March 2006, accounting for 49 and 57\% of the lake area in these study regions. Conversely, only 2\% of the lakes in the Teshekpuk region were frozen to the bottom by March 2006. Unfrozen water was more available because of deeper and more numerous lakes in the Teshekpuk Lake region (west) than in the Canning River area (east). While only specific SAR tiles were analyzed herein, the method will be a useful tool for land managers who seek to evaluate the potential for ice road construction across the Arctic.},

While part of the PP-C will degrade at point of thaw to CO2 and CH4 to directly amplify global warming, another part will enter the fluvial network, potentially providing a window to observe large-scale PP-C remobilization patterns. Here, we employ a decade-long, high-temporal resolution record of 14C in dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC and POC, respectively) to deconvolute PP-C release in the large drainage basins of rivers across Siberia: Ob, Yenisey, Lena, and Kolyma. The 14C-constrained estimate of export specifically from PP-C corresponds to only 17 {$\pm$} 8\% of total fluvial organic carbon and serves as a benchmark for monitoring changes to fluvial PP-C remobilization in a warming Arctic. Whereas DOC was dominated by recent organic carbon and poorly traced PP-C (12 {$\pm$} 8\%), POC carried a much stronger signature of PP-C (63 {$\pm$} 10\%) and represents the best window to detect spatial and temporal dynamics of PP-C release. Distinct seasonal patterns suggest that while DOC primarily stems from gradual leaching of surface soils, POC reflects abrupt collapse of deeper deposits. Higher dissolved PP-C export by Ob and Yenisey aligns with discontinuous permafrost that facilitates leaching, whereas higher particulate PP-C export by Lena and Kolyma likely echoes the thermokarst-induced collapse of Pleistocene deposits. Quantitative 14C-based fingerprinting of fluvial organic carbon thus provides an opportunity to elucidate large-scale dynamics of PP-C remobilization in response to Arctic warming.},

  abstract = {Empirical data indicate that hydraulic geometry relationships for single-thread sand-bed rivers (i.e., rivers with median bedmaterial size between 0.062 and 0.50 mm) can be delineated such that bankfull width, bankfull depth, and channel slope are related in consistent ways to bankfull discharge. Such relationships ought to be the external expression of physical relationships intrinsic to sandbed river dynamics. In this study, a back-calculation is performed to identify parameters (exponents and coefficients) for three relationships taken to be intrinsic to sand-bed rivers: (1) a generalized Manning-Strickler resistance relationship; (2) a relationship for channel-forming Shields number; and (3) a relationship for sand yield at bankfull flow. To back-calculate parameters for the physical relationships, first the hydraulic geometry relationships are expressed in suitable dimensionless form. Second, the physical relationships are expressed with coefficients and exponents that are analytically related to parameters in the hydraulic geometry relationships. Third, parameters from the hydraulic geometry relationships are used to calculate parameters for the physical relationships. The analysis yields the following results for the sand-bed rivers: (1) no physical basis exists for using an exponent of 1=6 in the resistance relationship; (2) channel-forming Shields number decreases with particle Reynolds number, and thus grain size, in a consistent way; and (3) sand concentration at bankfull flow must decline with increasing bankfull discharge. Although each of these relationships could have been established independently on its own, in this study they have been obtained as the only conclusions consistent with the observed hydraulic geometry relationships and the proposed physical framework. The analysis also yields a useful, dimensionally homogeneous predictive relationship for bankfull discharge as a function of bankfull width, bankfull depth, bed slope, and bed-material median grain size.

Existing global flood risk projections fail to integrate the combined dynamics of expected socio-economic development and climate change. We present the first global future river flood risk projections that separate the impacts of climate change and socio-economic development. The projections are based on an ensemble of climate model outputs2, socio-economic scenarios3, and a state-of-the-art hydrologic river flood model combined with socio-economic impact models4,5. Globally, absolute damage may increase by up to a factor of 20 by the end of the century without action. Countries in Southeast Asia face a severe increase in flood risk. Although climate change contributes significantly to the increase in risk in Southeast Asia6, we show that it is dwarfed by the effect of socio-economic growth, even after normalization for gross domestic product (GDP) growth. African countries face a strong increase in risk mainly due to socio-economic change. However, when normalized to GDP, climate change becomes by far the strongest driver. Both high- and low-income countries may benefit greatly from investing in adaptation measures, for which our analysis provides a basis.},

The two lower surfaces within the channel (called benches) are formed by suspended-load deposition. This is indicative of the low energy gradients (\textbackslash textless1.0 {$\cdot$} 10-4) and Froude numbers (\textbackslash textless0.1) which characterize within-channel flood waves. On the one hand there is the phenomenon of suspension of the medium sands found in the benches and on the other hand the phenomenon of deposition of the fine suspended load (80-95\% \textbackslash textless 2 {$\mu$}m). The higher bench is identified as the present flood plain. This level is flooded about once every year on the average. The two higher surfaces are relics, although some deposition occurs on them. Models are presented which see the past phases of river development and deposition as implicit in the hydraulic system. It is recognized that climatic change may play an additional role. Since similar streams and associated paleochannels characterize vast alluviated plains in Australia, these findings have wide application, particularly in relation to paleoenvironmental studies of ancient fluviatile sediments. \textcopyright{} 1979.},

The GFMS uses real-time satellite-based precipitation to derive flood monitoring parameters for the latitude band 50\textdegree N\textendash 50\textdegree S at relatively high spatial ({$\sim$}12 km) and temporal (3 hourly) resolution. Examples of model results for recent flood events are computed using the real-time GFMS (http://flood.umd.edu). To evaluate the accuracy of the new GFMS, the DRIVE model is run retrospectively for 15 years using both research-quality and real-time satellite precipitation products. Evaluation results are slightly better for the research-quality input and significantly better for longer duration events (3 day events versus 1 day events). Basins with fewer dams tend to provide lower false alarm ratios. For events longer than three days in areas with few dams, the probability of detection is {$\sim$}0.9 and the false alarm ratio is {$\sim$}0.6. In general, these statistical results are better than those of the previous system. Streamflow was evaluated at 1121 river gauges across the quasi-global domain. Validation using real-time precipitation across the tropics (30\textdegree S\textendash 30\textdegree N) gives positive daily Nash-Sutcliffe Coefficients for 107 out of 375 (28\%) stations with a mean of 0.19 and 51\% of the same gauges at monthly scale with a mean of 0.33. There were poorer results in higher latitudes, probably due to larger errors in the satellite precipitation input.},

Relations have been established between indices describing the mid-channel bars and the controlling variables, such as the channel width, the percentage silt-clay content in the channel boundary and the energy expenditure of flowing water. Bank erosion exerts a marked influence on the development of mid-channel bars after reservoir construction Bank erosion provides space and material for mid-channel bar formation, so bank erosion rate can be closely related to mid-channel bar indices. The middle channel bars exhibit a complex evolutionary response to the reservoir-regulated hydrological regime in the middle Hanjiang River. A descriptive model showing the complex response has been established. (C) 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Current global river routing models do not represent floodplain inundation dynamics realistically because the storage and movement of surface waters are regulated by small-scale topography rather than the commonly used spatial resolution of global models. In this study, we propose a new global river routing model, CaMa-Flood, which explicitly parameterizes the subgrid-scale topography of a floodplain, thus describing floodplain inundation dynamics. The relationship between water storage, water level, and flooded area in the model is decided on the basis of the subgrid-scale topographic parameters based on 1 km resolution digital elevation model. Horizontal water transport is calculated with a diffusive wave equation, which realizes the backwater effect in flat river basins. A set of global-scale river flow simulations demonstrated an improved predictability of daily-scale river discharge in many major world rivers by incorporating the floodplain inundation dynamics. Detailed analysis of the simulated results for the Amazon River suggested that introduction of the diffusive wave equation is essential for simulating water surface elevation realistically. The simulated spatiotemporal variation of the flooded area in the Amazon basin showed a good correlation with satellite observations, especially when the backwater effect was considered. The improved predictability for daily river discharge, water surface elevation, and inundated areas by the proposed model will promote climate system studies and water resource assessments.},

  abstract = {Global river models are an essential tool for both earth system studies and water resources assessments. As advanced physical processes have been implemented in global river models, increasing computational cost has become problematic for executing ensemble or long-term simulations. To improve computational efficiency, we here propose the use of a local inertial flow equation combined with a vector-based river network map. A local inertial equation, a simplified formulation of the shallow water equations, was introduced to replace a diffusion wave equation. A vector-based river network map which flexibly discretizes river segments was adopted in order to replace the traditional grid-based map which is based on a Cartesian grid coordinate system. The computational efficiency of the proposed flow routing and river network map was tested by executing hydrodynamic simulations with the CaMa-Flood global river model. The simulation results suggest that the computational efficiency can be improved by more than 300\% by applying the local inertial equation. It can be improved by a further 60\% by implementing the vector-based river network map instead of a grid-based map. It is found that the vector-based map with evenly distributed flow distances between calculation units allows longer time steps compared to the grid-based map because the latter has very short flow distances between calculation units at high latitudes which critically limit time step length. Considering the improvement in simulation speed, the local inertial equation, and a vector-based river network map are preferable in global hydrodynamic simulations with high computational demands such as ensemble or long-term experiments.},

We used 33,890 scenes from 4 GLS epochs in order to delineate a seamless water body map, without cloud and ice/snow gaps. Permanent water bodies were distinguished from temporal water-covered areas by calculating the frequency of water body existence from overlapping, multi-temporal, Landsat scenes. By analyzing the frequency of water body existence at 3arc-second resolution, the G3WBM separates river channels and floodplains more clearly than previous studies. This suggests that the use of multi-temporal images is as important as analysis at a higher resolution for global water body mapping. The global totals of delineated permanent water body area and temporal water-covered area are 3.25 and 0.49millionkm2 respectively, which highlights the importance of river-floodplain separation using multi-temporal images. The accuracy of the water body classification was validated in Hokkaido (Japan) and in the contiguous United States using an existing water body databases. There was almost no commission error, and about 70\% of lakes {$>$}1km2 shows relative water area error {$<$}25\%. Though smaller water bodies ({$<$}1km2) were underestimated mainly due to omission of shoreline pixels, the overall accuracy of the G3WBM should be adequate for larger scale research in hydrology, biogeochemistry, and climate systems and importantly includes a quantification of the temporal nature of global water bodies.},

  abstract = {In China, the Lower Jingjiang Reach (LJR) of the Yangtze River could be one of the most complicated areas in terms of channel migration. The river had undergone many channel changes in the reach since the 18th century. Intensive human activities in recent decades, such as the construction of upstream dams and revetments, had directly affected the channel migration characteristics. The revetment would significantly diminish migration, whereas the reduced sediment caused by dams would increase bank erosion and bank failure risks. Satellite imageries of Landsat Multi Spectral Scanner (MSS), Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) were employed to quantify the planform migration of the reach from 1983 to 2013 and to investigate the possible effect of human activities on the LJR channel evolution. Apart from the commonly used planform morphometric parameters, the migration direction was introduced to predict the future migration trends. Results showed that the LJR was gradually changing to a straighter channel, with sinuosity reducing from 2.09 to 1.9 and river length decreasing from 125.32 km to 113.31 km in the past 30 years. Planform morphometric parameters, such as migration rate of the channel centerline and erosion and deposition areas and rates, also decreased drastically in the past 30 years. The migration rate of the channel centerline decreased from 31.05 mea1 in 1983\textendash 1988 to 11.62 mea1 in 2009\textendash 2013. The lateral erosion and deposition areas decreased from 21.32 and 25.73 km 2 in 1983\textendash 1988 to 4.83 and 5.83 km 2 in 2009\textendash 2013. All of these findings indicate that the LJR tended to be in a steady state from 1983 to 2013 and was totally controlled by the bank revetments. However, the undercutting was strengthened because of the restrictive effect of revetments on lateral migration in the LJR. Moreover, the channel migrated to the left bank with a visible tendency as the total migration area to the left bank was approximately two times that of the right bank during the period. Consequently, the left bank of the LJR should be the focus of more attention in future migrations, and bank revetments of the left bank should be kept reinforced and adjusted with the change of water and sediment conditions.},

The Yangtze River Delta region has experienced a rapid and profound urbanization of any region worldwide in the past 30 years. The southeast Yinfeng plain in the Yangtze River Delta region was used as the study area to assess changes in the river network structure from 1990 to 2010, using river feature parameter analyses and GIS spatial analysis. The elastic method was adopted to analyse river network pattern response to both urbanization and climate change, and the rates at which these factors contributed to changes in the river network pattern were investigated. Changes in the storage capacity and flood control capacity of the channel network over the past 21 years were then analysed. The results indicated that: (1) the number of river networks, and the complexity of the river network spatial structures were reduced, the drainage density decreased by 20\%, the water surface ratio by 36\%, the river area\textendash length ratio by nearly 18\% and the fractal dimension of the river networks by 4.5\%; (2) the river network changes were due more to human activities than to climate change in this study period. Limited changes occurred in the structure of the river system, as indicated by an urbanization variability rate of less than 20\% and precipitation variability range of -5\% to -15\%, although the stream structure gradually decreased with increasing urbanization variability; and (3) the storage capacity of the main river network decreased earlier (1990\textendash 2003) and was restored later (2003\textendash 2010) because of dredging and widening activities. In addition, the number of lower-order rivers decreased, which resulted in significant decreases in the storage and flood control capacities of the river networks.

RivWidthCloud automatically extracts river centerline and widths from optical satellite images with the ability to flag observations that are obstructed by features like clouds, cloud shadows, and snow based on existing quality band classification. Because RivWidthCloud is built on a popular cloud computing platform, it allows users to easily apply the algorithm to the platform's vast archive of remote sensing images, thereby reducing the users' overhead for computing hardware and data storage. By comparing RivWidthCloudderived widths from Landsat images to in situ widths from the U.S. and Canada, we show that RivWidthCloud can estimate widths with high accuracy (root mean square error: 99 m; mean absolute error: 43 m; mean bias: -21 m). By making RivWidthCloud publicly available, we anticipate that it will be used to address both river science questions and operational applications of water resource management.},

Potential ecological risk analysis of sediment heavy metal concentrations indicated that six sites in the middle reach, half of the sites in the lower reach, and two sites in lakes, posed moderate or considerable ecological risk. Health risk analysis of individual heavy metals in fish tissue indicated safe levels for the general population and for fisherman but, in combination, there was a possible risk in terms of total target hazard quotients. Correlation analysis and PCA found that heavy metals (Hg, Cd, Pb, Cr, Cu, and Zn) may be mainly derived from metal processing, electroplating industries, industrial wastewater, and domestic sewage. Hg may also originate from coal combustion. Significant positive correlations between TN and As were observed.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to characterize the geomorphological processes controlling the dynamics of ponds and to identify and characterize groundwater infiltration and surface water dynamics for a tundra terrain located in discontinuous permafrost near Council, Alaska. Thermokarst processes and permafrost degradation were studied, focusing upon the interaction between surface and groundwater systems via an open talik. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data were used for classification of terrain units and surface water properties, while historical aerial photographs and satellite images (IKONOS) were used for assessment of pond shrinking and recent thermokarst progression. Geophysical surveys (ground penetrating radar and DC resistivity) were conducted to detect permafrost thickness and talik formations. Temperature boreholes and hydrological observation wells were monitored throughout the year and provided ground truth for validation of remotely-sensed data and geophysical surveys. Field and laboratory analyses enabled quantitative determination of subsurface hydrologic and thermal properties. We found many areas where alluvium deposits and ice-wedge polygonal terrain had developed thermokarst features within the last 20 years. Thermokarst ponds located over ice-wedge terrain have decreased in surface area since at least the early 20th Century. Small thermokarst features initially developed into tundra ponds perched over permafrost in response to some local disturbance to the surface. These thermokarst ponds grew larger and initiated large taliks that completely penetrated the permafrost. These taliks allowed internal drainage throughout the year causing the ponds to shrink under recent climatic conditions. Shrinking pond surface areas may become a common feature in the discontinuous permafrost regions as a consequence of warming climate and thawing permafrost.

In order to forecast terrestrial hydrology from monthly to seasonal time scales, a CM-SHF system should take advantage of important information from initial land surface conditions (ICs) as well as skillful seasonal predictions of atmospheric boundary conditions that mostly rely on the predictability of large-scale climate precursors such as the El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The progresses in the understanding of seasonal hydrologic predictability in terms of ICs and climate precursors are reviewed, and future emphases are discussed. Both the achievements and challenges of the CM-SHF system development, including multimodel ensemble prediction, seamless hydrologic forecasting, dynamical downscaling, hydrologic post-processing, and seasonal forecasting of hydrologic extremes with the hyper-resolution modeling framework that is able to address both the climate change and water resources management impacts on terrestrial hydrology, are presented. Regardless of great strides in CM-SHF, a grand challenge is the effective dissemination of the information provided by the seasonal hydrologic forecasting system to the decision-makers, which cannot be resolved without cross-disciplinary dialog and collaboration.

  abstract = {Advanced land surface models (LSMs) offer detailed estimates of distributed hydrological fluxes and storages. These estimates are extremely valuable for studies of climate and water resources, but they are difficult to verify as field measurements of soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and surface and subsurface runoff are sparse in most regions. In contrast, river discharge is a hydrologic flux that is recorded regularly and with good accuracy for many of the world's major rivers. These measurements of discharge spatially integrate all upstream hydrological processes. As such, they can be used to evaluate distributed LSMs, but only if the simulated runoff is properly routed through the river basins. In this study, a rapid, computationally efficient source-to-sink (STS) routing scheme is presented that generates estimates of river discharge at gauge locations based on gridded runoff output. We applied the scheme as a postprocessor to archived output of the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS). GLDAS integrates satellite and ground-based data within multiple offline LSMs to produce fields of land surface states and fluxes. The application of the STS routing scheme allows for evaluation of GLDAS products in regions that lack distributed in situ hydrological measurements. We found that the four LSMs included in GLDAS yield very different estimates of river discharge and that there are distinct geographic patterns in the accuracy of each model as evaluated against gauged discharge. The choice of atmospheric forcing data set also had a significant influence on the accuracy of simulated discharge.},

  abstract = {Thermal regimes of the active layer and permafrost and their relations to the present-day climatic conditions on the north slope of Alaska, U.S.A. were investigated by using data collected over six years and by numerical modelling. The thickness of the active layer increases from the Arctic coast to the foothills of the Brooks Range and is directly proportional to summer air temperatures and thawing index. Within about 120 km from the Arctic coast, mean annual air temperature for the period from 1987 through 1992 was nearly constant at about -12.4{$\lnot\pm$}0.4{$\lnot\infty$}C, while the mean annual ground surface and permafrost surface temperatures increased more than 4{$\lnot\infty$}C. Variations in the length of thaw season and thawing index are the major factors which influence permafrost temperatures during the summer. Interactions of wind, microrelief, vegetation and seasonal snow cover and variations of physical (such as density and structure) and thermal properties of snow are the major factors affecting permafrost temperatures during the winter. The insulating effect of the seasonal snow cover could be either positive or negative on a daily basis depending upon the synoptic weather processes and on a monthly basis depending upon the time of year. On an annual basis, seasonal snow cover could increase the mean annual ground surface temperature by 2 to 7{$\lnot\infty$}C. Over a decade, snow cover also shows a strong effect on permafrost temperatures. Modelling results show that the depth hoar fraction of the seasonal snow cover varies from about 0.31 along the coast to about 0.57 inland. Higher permafrost temperatures along the foothills of the Brooks Range are the results of warm winters due to the impact of less strong atmospheric temperature inversion. {$\lnot$}\textcopyright{} 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The results show that the area underlain by permafrost in Canada would be reduced by 16.0,\"A\`i19.7\% from the 1990s to the 2090s. This estimate was smaller than equilibrium projections because the ground thermal regime was in disequilibrium at the end of the 21st century and permafrost degradation would continue.

Here, we have profiled ARGs in sediments from 18 estuaries over 4,000 km of coastal China using high-throughput quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and investigated their relationship with bacterial communities, antibiotic residues and socio-economic factors. ARGs in estuarine sediments were diverse and abundant, with over 200 different resistance genes being detected, 18 of which were found in all 90 sediment samples. The strong correlations of identified resistance genes with known mobile elements, network analyses and partial redundancy analysis all led to the conclusion that human activity is responsible for the abundance and dissemination of these ARGs.

  abstract = {Bank retreat in the Jingjiang Reach is closely related not only to the near-bank intensity of fluvial erosion, but also to the composition and mechanical properties of bank soils. Therefore, it is necessary to correctly simulate bank retreat to determine the characteristics of fluvial processes in the Jingjiang Reach. The current version of BSTEM (5.4) was improved to predict riverbank retreat, by inputting a dynamic water table, and calculating the approximation of the distribution of dynamic pore water pressure in the soil near the river bank face, and considering the depositional form of the failed blocks, which is assumedly based on a triangular distribution, with the slope approximately equalling the stable submerged bank slope and half of collapsed volume deposited in the bank-toe region. The degrees of riverbank stability at Jing34 were calculated using the improved BSTEM. The results indicate the following trends: (i) the degrees of riverbank stability were high during the dry season and the rising stage, which led to minimal bank failure; and (ii) the stability degrees were low during the flood season and the recession stage, with the events of bank collapse occurring frequently, which belonged to a stage of intensive bank erosion. Considering the effects of bank-toe erosion, water table lag and the depositional form of the collapsed bank soil, the bank-retreat process was simulated at the right riverbank of Jing34. The model-predicted results exhibit close agreement with the measured data, including the total bank-retreat width and the collapsed bank profile. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the quantitative effects of toe erosion and water table lag on the degree of bank stability. The calculated results for toe erosion indicate that the amount of toe erosion was largest during the flood season, which was a primary reason for bank failure. The influence of water table lag on the degree of stability demonstrates that water table lag was an important cause of bank failure during the recession stage.},

The seasonal interactions between river, floodplain, and vegetation result in highly dynamic systems, which can exhibit markedly different biogeochemical patterns throughout a flood cycle. In this study, we determined rates and governing processes of organic matter turnover. Multi-probes in the Barotse Plains, a pristine floodplain in the Upper Zambezi River (Zambia), provided a high-resolution data set over the course of a hydrological cycle. The concentrations of oxygen, carbon dioxide, dissolved organic carbon, and suspended particulate matter in the main channel showed clear hysteresis trends with expanding and receding water on the floodplain. Lower oxygen and suspended matter concentrations prevailed at longer travel times of water in the floodplain, while carbon dioxide and dissolved organic carbon concentrations were higher when the water spent more time on the floodplain. Maxima of particulate loads occurred before highest water levels, whereas the maximum in dissolved organic carbon load occurred during the transition of flooding and flood recession. Degradation of terrestrial organic matter occurred mainly on the floodplain at increased floodplain residence times. Our data suggest that floodplains become more intense hotspots at prolonged travel time of the flood pulse over the floodplain.},
