# RivGraph

8/6/2019 - RivGraph is being prepared for "official release." The code is up-to-date, but has not been cleaned, commented, or sufficiently documented. There are currently no examples, but they are being prepared. 

For examples of what RivGraph does, see this AGU poster: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333322026_Determining_flow_directions_in_river_channel_networks_using_planform_morphology_and_topology

For description of part of the algorithm, see this paper: https://www.earth-surf-dynam-discuss.net/esurf-2019-19/ [under review].
