# RivGraph

RivGraph is a python package that assists with converting a binary mask of a channel network into a graph (set of links and nodes). One major component of RivGraph is its ability to automatically set flow directions in each link of the network. It also computes morphologic metrics (lengths, widths, branching angles, etc.) and topologic metrics.

Use RivGraph by creating either a delta or a river class, then applying the associated methods. As there is no documentation as of now, you will have to play with it and dig through the code a bit to understand how to use it. The rivgraph.py file contains these classes, as well as their methods, and should be a great starting place.

8/6/2019 - RivGraph is being prepared for "official release." The code is up-to-date, but has not been cleaned, commented, or sufficiently documented. There are currently no examples, but they are being prepared. 

For examples of what RivGraph does, see this AGU poster: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333322026_Determining_flow_directions_in_river_channel_networks_using_planform_morphology_and_topology

For description of part of the algorithm, see this paper: https://www.earth-surf-dynam-discuss.net/esurf-2019-19/ [under review].
