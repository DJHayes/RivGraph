key, type, length, description
id, orderedSet, N, unique link id assigned to each link not in a particular order and not guaranteed to skip some idâ€™s
conn, list of 2-element lists, N, node ids at link endpoints. After running directionality these are in order i.e. [us_nodeid ds_nodeid] 
idx, list of lists of ints, N, list of the pixel coordinates in index format (via np.ravel_index using the shape of the input binary image) 
n_networks, int, 1, number of networks identified
parallels, list of lists, varies, each sublist contains all link ids of links forming a parallel set; i.e. links that start and end at the same node. 
wid_pix, list of np.arrays, N, width at each pixel of each link (pixels defined by idx) 
len, list, N, length of each link
wid, list, N, average width of each link
len_adj, list, N, length of each link adjusted for accuracy
wid_adj, list, N, width of each link adjusted for accuracy
