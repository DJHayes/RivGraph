certain, np.array, N, 1 if the linkâ€™s direction has been set else 0
certain_order, np.array, N, describes the order in which links were set. Lower certain_order corresponds to earlier-set links.
certain_alg, np.array, N, algorithm id of the algorithm ultimately used to set the link direction
guess, list of lists, N, guesses of the upstream node id for each link; corresponds to guess_alg
guess_alg, list of lists, N, algorithm id used to compute guess; corresponds to guess
